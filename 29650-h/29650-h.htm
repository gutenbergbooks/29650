<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>OVERBURDENED</h3>
</div>
<p>It was winter in the great coniferous forest which rolls
about the rocky hills and shrouds the lonely valleys
of British Columbia. A bitter frost had dried the snow
to powder and bound the frothing rivers; it had laid
its icy grip upon the waters suddenly, and the sound of
their turmoil died away in the depths of the rock-walled
ca&ntilde;ons, until the rugged land lay wrapped in silence under
a sky of intense, pitiless blueness that seemed frozen
too. Man and beast shrink from the sudden cold snaps,
as they call them, in that country, and the rancher, who
has sheep to lose, sits shivering in his log house through
the long forenights with a Marlin rifle handy, while the
famished timber wolves prowl about his clearing. Still,
it is the loggers toiling in the wilderness who feel the cold
snaps most, for the man who labours under an Arctic frost
must be generously fed, or the heat and strength die out
of him, and, now and then, it happens that provisions become
scanty when no canoe can be poled up the rivers,
and the trails are blocked with snow.</p>
<p>There were four loggers at work in a redwood forest,
one January afternoon, rolling a great log with peevies
and handspikes out of a chaos of fallen trunks. The
Bush, a wall of sombre green, spangled here and there
with frost, and impressively still, closed in about the little
gap they had made. Not a sound came out of the shadowy
avenues between the tremendous colonnades of towering
trunks, and the topmost sprays of the cedars and
Douglas firs cut motionless against the blue high above.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
There was no wind, and the men&#8217;s breath went straight
up, a thin white vapour, into the biting air. Still, they
were warm and comparatively well fed, which was a
good deal to be thankful for, and three of them toiled
contentedly, with now and then a glance at their companion,
who realized at length that he was beaten. In
fact, it was only by calling up all the resolution that
was in him that this fourth man, Derrick Nasmyth, had
held himself to his task since early morning, for there is
no occupation which demands from man more muscular
effort and physical courage than logging, as it is generally
carried on in the forest of Western Canada.</p>
<p>Nasmyth was a tall man, apparently under thirty, and
leanly muscular, as were his companions, for those who
swing the axe from dawn to dusk in that wilderness
seldom put on flesh. His bronzed face was also lean,
and a trifle worn. Considering his occupation, it was,
perhaps, too finely chiselled, and there was a certain
elusive suggestion of refinement in it. He had clear blue
eyes, and the hair beneath his battered fur cap was brown.
For the rest, he wore a black leather jacket with several
rents in it, ragged duck trousers, and long boots. His
companions were the usual Bush choppers&ndash;&ndash;simple,
strong-armed men of kindly nature&ndash;&ndash;and Nasmyth was
quite aware that they had undertaken most of his share
in the work during the last few hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another heave!&#8221; said one of the woodsmen. &#8220;Hit
her hard, boys, and away she goes!&#8221;</p>
<p>They strained sinewy backs and splendid arms. The
great log rolled a trifle farther, canted, as one of them
slipped a handspike under the butt of it, and landed on
the skids, which were laid like railway sleepers down the
slope of a steep declivity. The snow was ground down
and rammed back about the skids, and the worn-out hollow
gleamed a faint blue-grey in the shadow of the firs.
The men made another strenuous effort as the log started,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
but in another moment it rushed away, and, like a toboggan,
sped downwards through the forest to the river-ice
below. The skids screamed beneath it, the snow flew
up like smoke, and then there was a thunderous crash
and stillness again. Nasmyth gasped heavily, and
dropped his handspike.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m used up. I&#8217;ll go along to the
shanty and get my time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He generally expressed himself much as his comrades
did, but now his clean English intonation was a little
more noticeable than usual. One of the others nodded
sympathetically, as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ve seen the trouble trailing you
for quite a while. Got to let up or play out. It&#8217;s one
I&#8217;ve been up against myself.&#8221; He made a vague gesture.
&#8220;A little rough on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he and one of his comrades took up a big crosscut
saw, while the other swung a gleaming axe. Nasmyth
walked back wearily through the silent Bush towards
the camp. His back ached, his head ached, and
he felt a trifle dazed. The strength seemed to have gone
out of him, and he fancied that he was not very far
from a physical collapse. He was glad when he reached
the shanty, where, after he had shaken the snow from
his dilapidated boots, he sat down by the glowing stove,
and smiled wryly as he looked about him. The shed
was rudely built of logs, and a row of bunks packed
with swamp-grass and spruce-twigs, from some of which
there hung portions of greasy blankets, ran down one
side of it. It smelt horribly of acrid tobacco and cookery,
but at least, it was warm, which counted for much, and,
during the last few months, Nasmyth had grown to
look on it as home. He knew, also, that it would cost
him something to leave it now, especially as he had nowhere
else to go.</p>
<p>Lying back listlessly in a lounge an ingenious chopper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
had made out of a few branches and a couple of sacks,
Nasmyth vaguely recalled the comfort of his London
chambers and the great pillared smoking-room of a certain
exclusive club, for he was a man acquainted with
the smoother side of life. He had various gifts which
were apparently of no account in British Columbia, and
he had enjoyed an education that had, it seemed, unfitted
him for anything strictly utilitarian. There are
a great many men of his description chopping trees
and driving cattle in Western Canada. Indeed, his
story was one which, with slight variations, may be heard
frequently in that country. Financial disaster had overtaken
his family. Friends in high places had regarded
him coldly, and he had been too proud to ask for favours,
or to profit by those that were grudgingly offered him.
That was why he had gone out to Canada and spent
several years there earning his board, and, now and
then, a few dollars as well, by bodily labour, until he
went up into the Bush with the loggers.</p>
<p>For a time he had somehow contrived to hold his own
with the other workers, though logging in heavy timber
is one of the tasks one could almost fancy that man was
never meant for, and the logger, whose overtaxed muscle
fails him for a moment, is very likely to have the
life crushed out of him by some ponderous, slipping trunk.
Perhaps, his lack of endurance was due to the excessive
strain, or the ill-cooked food, but during the last few
weeks he had been conscious that a slackness was creeping
over him. Once or twice the handspike or peevie
had been torn from his grasp, and the lives of his comrades
had been placed in peril. He had found it more
and more difficult to drag himself out to his work each
morning, but he had held on until that afternoon when
his strength had suddenly failed him.</p>
<p>Nasmyth was half-asleep when the cook and the leader
of the gang came in. The latter, who was a big, gaunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
man with grizzled hair, stopped close by the stove and
looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the gang leader, &#8220;what do you figure
you&#8217;re doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth explained with some difficulty, for in the
Bush, men acquire a certain pride in their physical manhood,
and it is never a pleasant thing to own oneself
defeated. The logger, however, nodded comprehendingly.
He was a reticent, grim-faced person from Ontario,
where they breed hard men, though some have,
also, kindly hearts in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite right. I&#8217;ve noticed it myself,&#8221; he
commented. &#8220;In fact, I&#8217;ve been figuring on asking
you to get out the last week or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. Like other men of his description
in that country, he had become accustomed to hearing
such remarks addressed to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he answered reflectively, &#8220;why you
didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The logger appeared to consider. It was characteristic
of him and the stock he sprang from that he would
never have admitted that he had borne with Nasmyth
as long as possible out of kindness. The thing would
have hurt him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it seemed to me we might start
you teaming, if I could have got a span or two of oxen
in, but I&#8217;m most afraid I can&#8217;t get them at my figure.&#8221;
He changed the subject abruptly. &#8220;Where are you
heading for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know, though I shall probably land in
Victoria sooner or later. I might strike something a
little easier than logging there. Still, it would be most
of a week&#8217;s march before I could reach the railroad, and
there&#8217;s not a ranch anywhere near the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The logger nodded. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d head
West instead. There&#8217;ll be nothing going on along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
railroad just now, and the mines are running easy,
while you ought to fetch the settlement south of Butte
Lake on the third day. Guess you might pick up a dollar
or two in that neighbourhood, and, any way, there&#8217;s a
steamer running down the West Coast to Victoria.
Seems to me quite likely one of those Bush-ranchers
would take you in a while, even if he didn&#8217;t exactly
want a hired man; but they don&#8217;t do that kind of thing
in the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. Experience had already taught him
that, as a rule, the stranger who is welcomed in the
cities arrives there with money in his pockets, and that
it is the hard-handed men with the axes from whom the
wanderer in that country is most likely to receive a
kindness. Still, though he was naturally not aware of
it, a great deal was to depend upon the fact that he followed
the advice of the logger, who traced out a diagram
on the bench upon which they sat.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an Indian trail up the river for the first four
leagues,&#8221; said the logger. &#8220;Then you strike southwest,
across the divide&ndash;&ndash;here&ndash;&ndash;and you come to the Butte
River. She&#8217;s running in a little ca&ntilde;on, and you can&#8217;t
get over &#8217;cept where a prospector or somebody has
chopped a big fir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The log span across a stream is an old device, and was
probably primitive man&#8217;s first attempt at bridge-building,
though it is one frequently adopted on the Pacific slope,
where a giant tree grows conveniently close to an otherwise
impassable river. It was, however, important that
Nasmyth should be able to find the tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know exactly where that fir is?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Southwest of the highest ridge of the divide. Once
you&#8217;re over, you&#8217;ll fetch the Butte Lake in a long day&#8217;s
march. When d&#8217;you figure you&#8217;ll start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;after supper. If there&#8217;s
sickness of any kind hanging round me&ndash;&ndash;and I feel like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
it&ndash;&ndash;you don&#8217;t want me here, and I dare say they&#8217;d take
me into the hospital at Victoria. Walking&#8217;s easier than
logging, anyway, and it seems wiser to try for that fir
in daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The logger nodded as if he concurred in this, and,
taking a little book from his pocket, he turned it over,
wrinkling his brows while Nasmyth watched him with a
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;we&#8217;ll count you full
time to-day, but there&#8217;s the four days off when you
got crushed by that redwood, and the week when you
chopped your leg. Then, counting the amount for your
board, that&#8217;s thirty-six dollars I&#8217;m due to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; answered Nasmyth. &#8220;There was the
day or two after I fell through the ice and had the
shivers. I&#8217;d sooner you knocked off the few dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The logger was said to be a hard man, and in some
respects this was certainly the case; but a faint flush
crept into his grim face. Perhaps he had noticed the
weariness in Nasmyth&#8217;s voice or the hollowness of his
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said awkwardly. &#8220;Jake will put you
up grub for four days, and we&#8217;ll call it square.&#8221;</p>
<p>He counted out the money, which Nasmyth slipped
into the receptacle inside his belt. When the logger
moved away the weary man crossed over to his bunk.
Nasmyth had brought his few possessions up in a canoe,
and now, knowing that he could not take them all away,
he turned them over with a curious smile. There were
one or two ragged pairs of duck trousers stained with
soil, a few old tattered shirts, and a jacket of much the
same description. He remembered that he had once
been fastidious about his tailoring, as he wondered when
he would be able to replace the things that he left behind.
Then he rolled up some of the garments and his two
blankets into a pack that could be strapped upon his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
shoulders, and, as he did this, his comrades came trooping
in, stamping to shake the snow off their leggings.</p>
<p>There were about a dozen of them&ndash;&ndash;simple, strenuous,
brown-faced Bush-ranchers for the most part&ndash;&ndash;and
they ate in haste, voraciously, when the abundant but
rudely served supper was laid out. Nasmyth had not
much appetite, and the greasy salt pork, grindstone
bread, desiccated apples, flavoured molasses, and flapjacks
hot from the pan, did not tempt him. He preferred
to watch his companions, and now and then his
glance was a trifle wistful. He had worked and eaten
with them; they had slept about him, and he knew he
had their rude good-will. When his strength had begun
to give way, some of them had saddled themselves with
more than their share of the tasks they were engaged
in, and he knew that it was possible he might not fall
in with comrades of their kind again. Now that the
time had come, he, who had once been welcomed at brilliant
London functions, felt that it would cost him an
effort to part with these rough comrades. Perhaps this
was not so astonishing, for, after all, strenuous, valiant
manhood and rude kindliness count for much.</p>
<p>The shanty was cheerfully lighted and cosily warm.
Nasmyth had slept soundly there on the springy spruce-twigs,
and there was at least abundance when the mealtimes
came round. Now he was about to be cast adrift
again to face a three days&#8217; march in the open, under the
bitter frost, and what might await him at the end of it
he did not know. At length, the meal was cleared
away, and when the pipes were lighted, he told his comrades
that he was going. They were not demonstrative
in their expressions of regret, but they thrust upon him
little plugs of tobacco, which could not well be replaced
there, and several of them told him that, if he struck
nothing he liked better, all he had to do was to present
himself at this ranch or the other beside blue lake or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
frothing river when they went back in the spring. What
was more to the purpose, they meant it.</p>
<p>Among those Western pines men are reared who, in
point of primitive vigour, slow endurance, and the dogged
courage that leads them to attempt, and usually to accomplish,
the apparently impossible, are a match for any
in the world, and no wanderer who limps up to their
lonely ranches is turned away. Those who have no
claim on them are honoured with their hospitality, and
now and then one new to that country looks with wonder
on their handiwork. Down all the long Pacific
coast, from lonely Wrangel, wrapped in the Northern
snow, to Shasta in the South, it is written on hewn-back
forest, rent hillside, and dammed river. The inhabitants
are subduing savage Nature; but, as time will
surely show, their greatest achievement is the rearing of
fearless men.</p>
<p>Though it cost him an effort, Nasmyth contrived to
smile as he shook hands with the loggers. Then he set
his lips tight as, with his pack strapped on his shoulders,
he opened the door and looked out at the dimly shining
snow. It was only natural that he hesitated for a
moment. After all, brutal as the toil had been, he at
least knew what he was leaving behind, and his heart
sank as he drew the door to. The cold struck through
him to the bone, though there was not a breath of air
astir, and the stillness was almost overwhelming. The
frost cramped his muscles and drove the courage out of
him, and, as he plodded down the trail, he heard
Jacques, the French-Canadian cook, tuning his battered
fiddle. A little burst of laughter broke through the
twanging of the strings, and Nasmyth closed one hand
hard as he strode on faster into the darkness. There
was as much of the animal in him as there is in most of
us, and he longed for the cheerful light and the warmth
of the stove, while one learns the value of human companionship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
when the Frost King lays his grip on that
lonely land. He was once more homeless&ndash;&ndash;an outcast&ndash;&ndash;and
it was almost a relief to him when at length the
twanging of the fiddle was lost in the silence of the pines.</p>
<p>The trees rose about him, towering high into the soft
darkness in serried ranks, and the snow gleamed a cold
blue-grey under them. Not a twig stirred; the tall
spires were black, and motionless, and solemn, and he
felt that their stateliness emphasized his own feebleness
and inconsequence. In the meanwhile, though the
snow was loose and frost-dried, it was not much above
his ankles, and the trail was comparatively good. It
seemed to him advisable to push on as fast as possible,
for he had only four days&#8217; provisions, and he was not sure
of his strength. There was no doubt as to what the result
would be if it failed him in the wilderness that lay
between him and the settlement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>A half-moon rose above the black tops of the
pines, and a faint light, which the snow flung back,
filtered down between the motionless branches upon the
narrow trail that wound sinuously in and out among
fallen trunks and thickets draped with withered fern,
for the Siwash Indians passed that way when the salmon
came up the rivers, and the path an Indian makes is
never straight. Over and over again, an Indian will go
around an obstacle through which the Bush-rancher
would hew a passage. This is essentially characteristic
of both, for the primitive peoples patiently fit their lives
to their environment, while the white man grapples
with unfavourable conditions, and resolutely endeavours
to alter them.</p>
<p>Until daylight Nasmyth made a tolerable pace. He
had been troubled with a curious lassitude and an unpleasant
dizziness, but walking is considerably easier
than rolling ponderous logs, and he knew that it was
advisable for him to push on as fast as possible. At
length, the dawn broke high up in a dingy grey sky, and
he stopped to build a fire. It did not take long to boil
a can of strong green tea, and to prepare a piece of
doughy bread, with a little salt pork, for his breakfast.
Then he wrapped one of his blankets around him and
took out his pipe. He did not remember how long he
sat there, but it was clear daylight when he noticed that
the fire was burning out, and, somewhat to his annoyance,
he felt curiously reluctant to get up again.</p>
<p>Though it cost him an effort, he rose, and stood a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
minute or two shivering in the bitter wind, which now
set the dark firs sighing. He could see the trees roll
upwards before him in sombre ranks until their topmost
sprays cut in a thin filigree very high up against the
sky, and he knew that he must now leave the easy trail
and cross the big divide. When he set out he was a little
annoyed to find that the pack-straps hurt his shoulders,
and that one of his boots galled his foot. Knee-boots
are not adapted for walking long distances, but the only
other ones that Nasmyth possessed were so dilapidated
that he had left them behind.</p>
<p>He went up for several hours through withered fern
and matted undergrowth, and over horrible tangles of
fallen tree-trunks, some of which were raised high above
the snow on giant splintered branches. The term &#8220;virgin
forest&#8221; probably conveys very little to the average
Englishman, since the woods with which he is acquainted
are, for the most part, cleaned and dressed by foresters;
but Nature rules untrammelled in the pine-bush of the
Pacific slope, and her waste material lies piled in tremendous
ruin until it rots away. There are forests in
that country, through which a man accustomed to them
can scarcely make a league in a day. Still, Nasmyth
crossed the divide, struggling against a bitter wind, and
then went down the other side, floundering over fallen
branches, and smashing through thickets of undergrowth
and brakes of willows. He wanted to find the river,
and, more especially, the tree that bridged it, as soon as
possible. It was, however, noon when he reached the
river, and it frothed and roared a hundred feet below
him in a smooth walled ca&ntilde;on, which had apparently
kept the frost out, for there were only strips of crackling
ice in the eddies.</p>
<p>It was clearly out of the question for him to get down
to the river, even if he had wished to make the descent,
and without stopping to make another fire, he plodded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
along the bank until the afternoon was almost spent.
There were a good many fallen trees, as he discovered
to his cost, since each one had to be painfully clambered
over, but none of them spanned the chasm. Then, as
his foot was becoming very sore, he decided to camp
where a big cedar lay across a little ravine that rent the
bank. It promised to afford him a partial shelter. He
had no axe, but he tore off an armful or two of the thinner
branches, with the twigs attached to them, to form
a bed, and then, crawling down to the river, filled his
smoke-blackened can and came back wearily to make a
fire. Man needs very little in those solitudes, but there
are two things he must have, and those are food to keep
the strength in him, and warmth, though there are times
when he finds it singularly difficult to make the effort to
obtain them. The most unpleasant hour of the long day
of persistent toil is often the one when worn-out muscle
and jaded intelligence must be forced to the task of providing
the evening meal and shelter for the night.</p>
<p>Nasmyth ate his supper, so far as it went, voraciously,
but with a prudent check upon his appetite, for he had
set out with only four days&#8217; provisions, and he could not
find the tree. When he had eaten, he took out his pipe,
and crouched a while beside the fire, shivering, in spite of
the blankets wrapped about him. The heat dies out of
the man who has marched for twenty hours, as those
who have done it know. In the meanwhile, darkness
crept up from the east, and the pines faded into sombre
masses that loomed dimly against a leaden sky. A
mournful wailing came out of the gloom, and the smoke
whirled about the shivering man in the nipping wind,
while the sound of the river&#8217;s turmoil and the crash of
stream-driven ice drifted up out of the ca&ntilde;on. Nasmyth
listened drowsily, while his thoughts wandered
back to the loggers&#8217; shanty. He could see the men with
bronzed faces sitting smoking about the snapping stove,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
two or three of them dancing, while Jacques coaxed
music full of fire from his battered fiddle.</p>
<p>Then his thoughts went farther back to the chambers
that he had once occupied in London, and he saw himself
and Frobisher, who shared them with him, sitting
at a little table daintily furnished with choice glass and
silver covers. There were big candles upon it&ndash;&ndash;Frobisher,
who was a fastidious man, had insisted upon
them. After that, the artistically furnished room faded
out of his memory, and he recalled a larger one in which
he had now and then dined. He could picture the wine,
and lights, and costly dresses, the smiling faces of those
who had at that time expected a great deal from him,
and he saw the girl who usually sat at his side. She had
a delicate beauty and a dainty mind, and he had sometimes
fancied they might be drawn closer when he had
made his mark, which in those days appeared a very
probable thing. He wondered vaguely what she was
doing then, or if she ever thought of him. After all, as
she had not answered the one letter which he wrote, it
scarcely seemed likely that she remembered him. Those
who fail, he reflected, are soon forgotten.</p>
<p>Then, as he was falling forward into the fire, he
roused himself, and smiled wryly. He was once more
an outcast, shivering, half-asleep in the wilderness, worn
out, ragged, and aching, with a foot that was now distinctly
painful. It is, however, fortunate for such men
as he, and others among the heavily burdened, that the
exhaustion of the body has its deadening effect upon
the mind. Rolling the blankets round him, he lay down
on the cedar branches and went to sleep.</p>
<p>He did not hear the timber wolves howling in the
blackness of the night, though several that got wind of
him flitted across the ravine after the fire burned low,
and, when at length he awakened, it was with the fall of
a wet flake upon his face, and he saw the dim dawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
breaking through a haze of sliding snow. It seemed a
little warmer, and, as a matter of fact, it was so, for the
cold snaps seldom last very long near the coast; but the
raw damp struck through him as he raked the embers of
the fire together. Again he felt singularly reluctant to
start when he had finished breakfast, and he found that
he could hardly place one foot upon the ground; but
haste was imperative now, so he set off limping, with
the pack-straps galling his shoulders cruelly. He also
felt a little dizzy, but he pushed on all that day beside
the river through a haze of snow without coming upon
the tree. The dusk was creeping up across the forest
when at length the river emerged from the ca&ntilde;on, and
he ventured out upon the ice in a slacker pool. The ice
heaved and crackled under him with the pulsations of the
stream, but he got across, and roused himself with difficulty
for the effort to make another fire. He was an
hour gathering fuel, and then, after a sparing supper, he
lay down in his wet clothing.</p>
<p>The snow that eddied about him whitened his spongy
blankets, but he got a little sleep, and, awakening, found
the fire out. He tried to light it and failed. His
fingers seemed useless. He was cramped and chilled
all through, and there was in one hip-joint the gnawing
pain that those who sleep on wet ground are acquainted
with. Sometimes it goes away when one gets warmed
up, but just as often it does not. Nasmyth, who found
it a difficult matter to straighten himself, ate a little
damp bread, and then, strapping his pack upon his
shoulders, stumbled on into the forest. He afterwards
fancied it did not snow very much that day, but he was
not sure of anything except that he fell over many rotten
branches, and entangled himself frequently in labyrinths
of matted willows. Night came and he went to sleep
without a fire. He contrived to push on next day,
walking during most of it half asleep. Indeed, now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
then he would stagger along for minutes after consciousness
of what he was doing had deserted him, for there
are men in that Bush, at least, who know what it is to
stop with suddenly opened eyes on the verge of a collapse,
and find that they have wandered from the path&ndash;&ndash;only
in Nasmyth&#8217;s case there was no path at all.</p>
<p>He was never sure whether it was that day or the next
when, floundering through an undergrowth of willows,
he came upon a break in the forest that was covered
with sawn-off stumps. As he made for it, he fell into
a split-rail fence, some of which he knocked down until
he could climb over it. There was a faint smell of
burning fir-wood in the air, and it was evident to him
that there was a house somewhere in the vicinity. The
snow was not deep in the clearing, and he plodded
through it, staggering now and then, until he came to
a little slope, and fell down it headlong. This time he
did not seem able to get up again, and it was fortunate
that, when he flung the split fence down, the crash made
by the falling rails rang far through the silence of the
woods.</p>
<p>While Nasmyth lay in the slushy snow, a girl came
out from among the firs across the clearing, and walked
down the little trail that led to a well. She was tall,
and there was something in her face and the way she
held herself which suggested that she was not a native
of the Bush, though everything she wore had been made
by her own fingers&ndash;&ndash;that is, except the little fur cap,
whose glossy brown enhanced the lustre of her hair.
This was of a slightly lighter tint, and had gleams of
ruddy gold in it. Her eyes were large and brown, and
there was a reposeful quietness in the face, which suggested
strength. It was significant that her hands were
a trifle hard, as well as shapely, and that her wrists
were red.</p>
<p>She came to the top of the slope near the foot of which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
Nasmyth, who had now raised himself on one elbow,
lay, and though this might well have startled her, she
stood quietly still, looking down on him. Nasmyth
raised himself a trifle further, and blinked at her
stupidly, and she noticed that his face was drawn and
grey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the rails fall,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What are you
doing there?&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not appear strange to Nasmyth that she
should speak in well-modulated English, for there are
probably as many insular English as Canadians in parts
of that country. Besides, he was scarcely in a condition
to notice a point of that kind just then.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I upset the fence,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You
see, I couldn&#8217;t get over. Then I must have fallen
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>It naturally struck the girl as significant that he did
not seem sure of what had happened, but the explanation
that would have suggested itself to anyone fresh
from England did not occur to her. There was not a
saloon or hotel within eight or nine miles of the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you get up?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said Nasmyth; but the attempt he made
was not a complete success, for, although he staggered
to his feet, he reeled when he stood upon them, and
probably would have fallen had she not run down the
slope and taken hold of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can rest on me,&#8221; she said, laying a firm and
capable hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>With her assistance, Nasmyth staggered up the slope,
and there were afterwards times when he remembered
the next few minutes with somewhat mixed feelings.
Just then, however, he was only glad to have someone
to lean upon, and her mere human presence was a relief,
since Nature had come very near to crushing the life out
of him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&#8220;This is your ranch?&#8221; he inquired, looking at her
with half-closed eyes, when at length she moved away
from him, a pace or two, and, gasping a little, stood still,
beneath a colonnade of towering firs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; she said simply; and a moment or two later
he saw a little house of logs half hidden among the
trees.</p>
<p>They reached it in another minute, and, staggering
in, he sank into the nearest chair. A stove snapped and
crackled in the middle of the little log-walled room,
which in spite of its uncovered, split-boarded floor, seemed
to possess a daintiness very unusual in the Bush. He did
not, however, know what particular objects in it conveyed
that impression, for the whole room seemed to be
swinging up and down; but he was definitely conscious
of a comforting smell of coffee and pork, which came
from the stove. He sat still, shivering, and blinking at
the girl, while the water trickled from his tattered clothing.
He fancied from the patter on the shingle roof,
that it was raining outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you would let me camp in the barn to-night,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes had grown compassionate as she
watched him, for there was a suggestive greyness in his
face. It was evident to her that he was utterly worn-out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go in there,&#8221; she said, pointing to a door. &#8220;You
will find some dry clothes. Put them on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth staggered into a very small room, which
had a rude wooden bunk in it, and with considerable
difficulty sloughed off his wet things and put on somebody
else&#8217;s clothing. Then he came back and sank into
a deer-hide lounge at the table. The girl set a cup of
coffee, as well as some pork and potatoes, before him.
He drank the coffee, but finding, somewhat to his astonishment,
that he could scarcely eat, he lay back in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
chair and looked at the girl deprecatingly with half-closed
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t do the supper justice. I think I&#8217;m
ill,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Then his head fell back against the deer-hide lounge,
and, while the girl watched him with a natural consternation,
he sank into sleep or unconsciousness. She
was not sure which it was, but he certainly looked very
ill, and, being a capable young woman, she remembered
that within the next hour, the weekly mail-carrier would
strike a trail which passed within a mile of the ranch.
Rising, she touched Nasmyth&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay there, and don&#8217;t try to get up until I come
back,&#8221; she commanded in a kindly tone.</p>
<p>Nasmyth, as she had half-expected, said nothing, and,
slipping into another room&ndash;&ndash;there were three in the
house&ndash;&ndash;she returned, wearing a jacket of coarse fur, and
went quietly out into the rain. It was dark now, but
she had, as it happened, not long to wait for the mail-carrier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to call at Gordon&#8217;s ranch, Dave,&#8221; she
told the man. &#8220;Tell him he is to come along as soon
as he can. There&#8217;s a stranger here who seems very ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mail-carrier would have asked questions, but she
cut him short.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it be before you can tell Gordon?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the man reflectively, &#8220;I&#8217;m heading
right back for the settlement, but it&#8217;s a league to Gordon&#8217;s,
anyway. He could be here in two hours, if he
starts right off, and, considering what the trail&#8217;s like,
that&#8217;s blamed fast travelling.&#8221;</p>
<p>He disappeared into the darkness, and the girl went
back to the ranch. It was, perhaps, significant that she
should feel sure that the man she had sent for would
obey the summons, but she grew anxious while the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
hours slipped by. At last, a man opened the door and
walked in, with the water dripping from the long outer
garment he flung off. He was a young man, with a
bronzed face and keen grey eyes, and he had swung the
axe, as one could see by his lithe carriage and the hardness
of his hands, but there was something professional
in his manner as he stooped down, regarding Nasmyth
closely while he gripped the stranger&#8217;s wrist. Then he
turned to the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very sick,&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;Guess you have
no objections to my putting him in your father&#8217;s bunk.
First, we&#8217;ll warm the blankets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl rose to help him, and&ndash;&ndash;for she was strong&ndash;&ndash;they
stripped off most of Nasmyth&#8217;s garments and lifted
him into the bunk in the next room. Then Gordon
sent her for the blankets, and, when he had wrapped
them round Nasmyth, he sat down and looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pneumonia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anyway, in the meanwhile,
I&#8217;ll figure on it as that, though there&#8217;s what one
might call a general physical collapse as well. Where
did he come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father won&#8217;t be back for a week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s scarcely likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man appeared to reflect for a moment or two.
Then he made a little expressive gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s up to us to do what we can.
First thing&#8217;s a poultice. I&#8217;ll show you how to fix it;
but while we&#8217;re here, I guess we might as well run
through his things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that needful?&#8221; and the girl glanced at Nasmyth
compassionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the man with an air of reflection, &#8220;it
might be. This thing&#8217;s quick. Leaves you or wipes
you out right away. There&#8217;s very little strength in
him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>He turned out the pockets of Nasmyth&#8217;s clothes,
which were, however, empty of anything that might
disclose his identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a scrap of paper, not a dollar; but I guess that
wasn&#8217;t always the case with him&ndash;&ndash;you can see it by his
face,&#8221; he said. Then he laughed. &#8220;He&#8217;s probably like
a good many more of us&ndash;&ndash;not very anxious to let folks
know where he came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl, though he did not notice it, winced at this;
but next moment he touched her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get some water on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After we&#8217;ve made
the poultice, I&#8217;ll take charge of him. We may get Mrs.
Custer round in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl merely smiled and went out with him. She
was aware that it was in some respects an unusual thing
which she was doing, but that did not greatly trouble
her. They are not very conventional people in that
country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>WAYNEFLEET&#8217;S RANCH</h3>
</div>
<p>Though he afterwards endeavoured to recall them,
Nasmyth had never more than a faint and shadowy
recollection of the next few days. During most of
the time, he fancied he was back in England, and the girl
he had left there seemed to be hovering about him. Now
and then, she would lay gentle hands upon him, and
her soothing touch would send him off to sleep again;
but there was a puzzling change in her appearance.
He remembered her as slight in figure&ndash;&ndash;sylph-like he
had sometimes called her&ndash;&ndash;fastidious and dainty, and
always artistically dressed. Now, however, she seemed
to have grown taller, stronger, more reserved, and, as
he vaguely realized, more capable, while her garments
were of a different and coarser fashion. What was still
more curious, she did not seem to recognize her name,
though he addressed her by it now and then. He pondered
over the matter drowsily once or twice, and then
ceased to trouble himself about it. There were several
other things that appeared at least as incomprehensible.</p>
<p>After a long time, however, his senses came back to
him, and one evening, as he lay languidly looking about
him in his rude wooden bunk, he endeavoured to recall
what had passed since he left the loggers&#8217; camp. The
little room was comfortably warm, and a plain tin lamp
burned upon what was evidently a home-made table.
There was nothing, except a rifle, upon the rough log
walls, and nothing upon the floor, which was, as usual,
rudely laid with split boards, for dressed lumber is costly
in the Bush. Looking through the open door into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
general living-room, which was also lighted, he could
see a red twinkle beneath the register of the stove, beside
which a woman was sitting sewing. She was a hard-featured,
homely person in coarsely fashioned garments,
which did not seem to fit her well, and Nasmyth felt
slightly disconcerted when he glanced at her, for she
was not the woman whom he had expected to see. Then
his glance rested on a man, who had also figured in his
uncertain memories, and now sat not far away from
him. The man, who was young, was dressed in plain
blue duck, and, though Nasmyth noticed that his hands
were hard, and that he had broken nails, there was
something in his bronzed face that suggested mental
capacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; the sick man said, &#8220;you are the doctor
who has evidently taken care of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was not quite himself yet, and he spoke clean
colloquial English, without any trace of the Western
accentuation he usually considered it advisable to adopt,
though, as a matter of fact, the accent usually heard on
the Pacific slope is not unduly marked. The other man
naturally noticed it, and laughed somewhat curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some knowledge of medicine and surgery,&#8221;
Gordon answered. &#8220;Now and then I make use of it,
though I don&#8217;t, as a rule, get a fee.&#8221; Then he looked
rather hard at Nasmyth. &#8220;Quite a few of us find it
advisable to let our professions go when we come to
this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded, for this was a thing he had discovered
already. Many of the comrades he had made
there were outcasts&ndash;&ndash;men outside the pale&ndash;&ndash;and they
were excellent comrades, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have evidently been very sick.
How did I get here? I don&#8217;t seem to remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Waynefleet found you lying in the snow in the
clearing.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Nasmyth&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a tall girl with a quiet
voice, big brown eyes, and splendid hair?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon smiled. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s quite like
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is she now?&#8221; asked Nasmyth; and though
he was very feeble still, there was a certain expectancy
in his manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the barn, I believe. The working oxen have to
be fed. It&#8217;s very probable that you will see her in
the next half-hour. As to your other question&ndash;&ndash;you were
very sick indeed&ndash;&ndash;pneumonia. Once or twice it seemed
a sure thing that you&#8217;d slip through our fingers. Where
were you coming from when you struck the clearing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth, who had no reason for reticence, and found
his mind rapidly growing clearer, briefly related what
had led him to set out on his journey through the Bush,
and his companion nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very much as I expected,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They
paid you off before you left that logging camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They did,&#8221; said Nasmyth, who was pleased to recall
the fact. &#8220;I had thirty-two dollars in my belt.&#8221;</p>
<p>His companion looked at him steadily. &#8220;When you
came here you hadn&#8217;t a belt on. There was not a dollar
in your pockets, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was naturally a blow to Nasmyth. He realized
that it would probably be several weeks at least before
he was strong enough to work again, and he had evidently
been a charge upon these strangers for some little
time. Still, he did not for a moment connect any of
them with the disappearance of his belt. He was too
well acquainted with the character of the men who are
hewing the clearings out of the great forests of the
Pacific slope. As a matter of fact, he never did discover
what became of his belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I suppose I forgot to put it on, one
of those mornings on the march. Still, it&#8217;s not very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
astonishing that the thing should worry me. I can&#8217;t
expect to stay on at this ranch. When do you think I
can get up and set out again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Been out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re from the Old Country&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
plain enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case I&#8217;m not going to tell you we&#8217;re not
likely to turn you out until you have some strength in
you. I believe I&#8217;m speaking for Miss Waynefleet now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth lay still and considered this. It was, at
least, quite evident that he could not get up yet, but
there were one or two other points that occurred to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the ranch belong to Miss Waynefleet?&#8221; he
inquired. &#8220;She can&#8217;t live here alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She runs the concern. She has certainly a father,
but you&#8217;ll understand things more clearly when you see
him. He&#8217;s away in Victoria, which is partly why Mrs.
Custer from the settlement is now in yonder room. Her
husband is at present building a trestle on the Dunsmore
track. I come up here for only an hour every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth afterwards discovered that this implied a
journey of three or four miles either way over a very
indifferent trail, but at the moment he was thinking
chiefly of Miss Waynefleet, who had given him shelter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You practise at the settlement?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his companion dryly, &#8220;chopping big trees.
I&#8217;ve a ranch there. Still, I don&#8217;t know that you could
exactly call it practising. By this time, I&#8217;ve acquired a
certain proficiency in the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth fancied that he must have gone to sleep
soon after this, for when he opened his eyes again there
was no sign of the doctor, and a girl was quietly moving
about the room. She sat down, when she saw that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
was awake, and looked at him with a little smile, and
it was only natural that Nasmyth should also
look at her. It struck him once more that she had wonderful
hair. In the lamp-light, it seemed to glow with
curious red-gold gleams. She had also quiet brown eyes,
and a face that was a trifle darkened by sun and wind.
He guessed that she was tall. She looked so as she moved
about the room with a supple gracefulness that had a
suggestion of strength in it. That was all he noticed
in detail, for he was chiefly conscious of the air of quiet
composure that characterized her. He was a trifle fanciful
that night, and, while he looked her, he felt as
he had sometimes felt when he stood at sunset in the
silence of the shadowy Bush, or gazed down into the
depths of some still river pool. Only her gleaming red-gold
hair and her full red lips slightly counteracted this
impression. There was in them at least a hint of fire
and passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are much better,&#8221; she said, and her softly modulated
voice fell pleasantly on his ears. He contrived
to raise himself a trifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I am,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;In any case, I know
I owe it to you that I&#8217;m alive at all. Still&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and he
hesitated&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I can&#8217;t help feeling a bit uncomfortable.
You see, I have really no claim on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura Waynefleet laughed. &#8220;Did you expect me to
leave you out in the snow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had, I couldn&#8217;t have complained. There
wasn&#8217;t the least obligation upon you to look after a
penniless stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the girl, with a little smile which was
curiously expressive, &#8220;after all, many of us are in one
sense strangers in the Bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth pondered over this, for, in view of what he
had noticed in her voice and manner, he fancied he understood
her meaning.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s evident that I can do nothing
in return for all your kindness, except take myself off
your hands as soon as possible. That&#8217;s partly why I&#8217;m
particularly anxious to get better.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped a moment, with a faint flush in his hollow
face. &#8220;It sounds very ungracious, doesn&#8217;t it? But, after
all, it&#8217;s sense. Besides, I scarcely feel up to expressing
myself very neatly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl moved across the room, and gently pressed
him down again on the pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to sleep again at once,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth did as he was bidden, which, since he felt
that he wanted to lie awake and watch her, was in one
way significant. As a matter of fact, what Laura
Waynefleet considered advisable was usually done. Nasmyth&#8217;s
head was clearer next morning, and, during the
week that followed, he grew stronger rapidly, until one
night, as he sat beside the stove, he realized that he could,
in all probability, set out again on his journey in a day
or two. While he talked to Laura Waynefleet, there
were footsteps outside, and she ran towards the door as
a man came into the room. Nasmyth fancied the newcomer
was her father, for he was grey-haired and elderly,
but he did not look in the least like a Bush-rancher. Beneath
the fur coat, which he flung off when he had kissed
his daughter, he was dressed as one who lived in the cities,
though his garments were evidently far from new. He
was tall, but his spareness suggested fragility, and his
face, which emphasized this impression, had a hint of
querulous discontent in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to get through until to-morrow, but
they&#8217;ve altered the running of the stage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wiston
drove me up from the settlement, and said he&#8217;d send
my things across to-morrow. I was glad to get out of
Victoria. The cooking and accommodation at the hotel
I stayed at were simply disgusting.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth glanced at the speaker in amused astonishment,
for the Bush-ranchers of the Pacific slope are not,
as a rule, particular. They can live on anything, and
sleep more or less contentedly among dripping fern, or
even in a pool of water, as, indeed, they not infrequently
have to do, when they go up into the forests
surveying, or undertake a road-making contract. Laura
Waynefleet directed her father&#8217;s attention to her convalescent
guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Nasmyth,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You will remember
I mentioned him in my letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet made the young man a little inclination
that was formally courteous. &#8220;I am glad to see you
are evidently recovering,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope they have
made you at home here.&#8221; Then he turned to his daughter.
&#8220;If you could get me some supper&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura busied herself about the stove, while Waynefleet
sat down and talked to Nasmyth about generalities.
Waynefleet appeared to be a politician, and he criticized
the Government, which, in his opinion, was neglecting
the Bush-ranchers shamefully. It was evident that he
considered it the duty of the Government to contribute
indirectly towards the support of settlers. Then the supper
was laid out. As he ate fastidiously, he made a few
faintly sardonic observations about the cookery, and,
after the girl had brought in a pot of coffee, he frowned
at the cup he put down.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one place in Victoria where you can get
coffee, as it ought to be, but this is merely roasted wheat,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You will excuse me from drinking any more
of it. As you have probably discovered, Mr. Nasmyth,
one has to put up with a good deal in this country. It
is in many respects a barbarous land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth saw the faint flush in Laura Waynefleet&#8217;s
face, and said nothing. He fancied that he knew the
establishment in Victoria to which Waynefleet referred,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
but it was not one which he had ever visited, or which
the smaller Bush-ranchers usually frequented.</p>
<p>Soon after supper, Nasmyth withdrew to the bed,
which he had insisted on preparing for himself in the
loft above the stables, and it was next day when he spoke
to Laura Waynefleet alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t abuse your kindness any longer,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I must go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him quietly. &#8220;You are far from
strong yet, and&ndash;&ndash;it must be mentioned&ndash;&ndash;there was not
a dollar in your pockets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is certainly the case;&#8221; and Nasmyth flushed a
little. &#8220;Still, I can get as far as the settlement, and
I dare say somebody, who won&#8217;t be too hard on me at
first, may want a hand. I am really rather a good
chopper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura smiled as she glanced at his face, but it was
not its hollowness she was thinking of. Nasmyth had
not the appearance of the average chopper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;perhaps you had better see my
father. I think he has something to say to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She left him, and, half an hour later, Waynefleet came
up to Nasmyth, who was sunning himself outside the
ranch-house. Like many other houses in that country, it
stood beneath a few great firs on the edge of a desolate
clearing, round which the primeval forest rose in an
unbroken wall. Behind it, and a little farther back
among the trees, was the rude barn, built of big notched
logs, and roofed with cedar shingles. In front there lay
some twenty acres of cleared land, out of which rose the
fir-stumps, girdled with withered fern, for a warm wind
from the Pacific had swept the snow away. Beyond that,
in turn, and outside the split-rail fence, rows of giant
trunks lay piled in the tremendous ruin usually called the
&#8220;slashing.&#8221; Some day, these would be sawn up and
burnt, and the clearing driven farther back into the Bush.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
The little gap into which the sunlight shone, however,
had been hewn out at the cost of several years of strenuous
labour, and Nasmyth, who was aware of this, felt
inclined to smile as the man who owned it strolled
up to him. It was a little difficult to imagine that he
had had any great share in the making of that clearing.</p>
<p>Waynefleet was dressed in duck, but it was whole
and unsoiled, and Nasmyth made his own deductions
from a glance at the delicate hands. As a rule, Waynefleet&#8217;s
expression was discontented and querulous, but
for the time being his manner was gracious. In fact,
he was generally more or less courteous to Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Waynefleet tells me you are thinking of going
away,&#8221; said the owner of the ranch.</p>
<p>Nasmyth replied that he intended to leave the ranch,
and was explaining that he felt he had already abused
his host&#8217;s kindness, when Waynefleet cut him short.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been glad to have you here,&#8221; he said; &#8220;in
fact, I have been wondering if you might feel disposed
to stay. It is probably evident to you that I cannot do
all that is necessary about this place with one pair of
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth knew, from what he had seen on other and
larger ranches, that one man could do the work, though
he felt that it was more than one could reasonably have
expected from Waynefleet. It was, however, clear that
somebody did a great deal, and he fancied that it was
the rancher&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Waynefleet, &#8220;I am disposed to
spend a little upon the ranch. They are talking of
building a pulp-mill near the settlement. That will
make land more valuable, and probably lead to a demand
for produce. With that in view, I wish to raise a larger
crop, and I&#8217;m open to hire somebody.&#8221; He made a little
gesture. &#8220;My strength scarcely permits me to undertake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
any severe physical effort, and I may confess that
my faculty is rather that of administration. Now I will
make you an offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth considered it gravely. As it happened, he
was feeling sorry for the rancher&#8217;s daughter, and it was
this fact chiefly which led him to come to terms with the
man, since it seemed to him that there were tasks the
girl must shrink from&ndash;&ndash;tasks of which he could relieve
her. Though he was quite aware that when his strength
came back, he could probably earn more than Waynefleet
offered him, he accepted the chance to stay at the ranch.
Moreover, the varied work was likely to be much easier
than logging.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain. I&#8217;ll make a start now, and haul one
or two of those logs out with the oxen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Still,
I&#8217;m afraid you must not expect too much from me for
a week or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet made no objections. There was, as a matter
of fact, a great deal to be done, and Nasmyth went
back to his new quarters over the stable almost too
weary to hold himself upright that night. He, however,
gathered strength rapidly, and a few days later he was
chopping a great tree, standing on a narrow plank notched
into the trunk of it several feet from the ground as he
swung the axe, when the man who had instructed Miss
Waynefleet how to nurse him came up the trail. Gordon
sat down on a log close by, and looked at Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was coming round to make sure I was quite through
with your case, but it&#8217;s tolerably evident you have no
more use for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Stopping here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said he was, and Gordon nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in several ways I&#8217;m rather glad.
It&#8217;s going to make things easier for Miss Waynefleet.
Guess you understand what I meant when I said she
ran the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth said he thought he did, and then, with a
certain diffidence, he changed the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have spent a good deal of time looking
after men&ndash;&ndash;professionally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gordon laughed in a somewhat curious fashion.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll let that go. In one sense, I&#8217;ve dropped my profession.
I had to, and it&#8217;s scarcely likely that I shall
take it up again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Nasmyth reflectively, &#8220;if it&#8217;s admissible
for me to mention that I had fancied something
of the kind. You see, in the Bush, I have naturally
come across a good many men who have turned their
backs upon the cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon made a little gesture. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sure thing you&#8217;ll
hear a good deal about me at the settlement, where,
though the boys don&#8217;t cast it up to me, I&#8217;m credited
with having killed somebody back East, and as I&#8217;ve had an
idea that I could hit it rather well with you, I&#8217;d
sooner tell you the thing myself. Well, I was making
my mark in a big city, several years ago, when I lost my
head. When success comes too quickly, it&#8217;s a thing you&#8217;re
rather apt to do. The trouble is that you have usually
to face the results of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment with a little wry smile.
&#8220;In my case they were serious. There was a woman
of hysterical temperament with a diseased imagination.
I was overworked and a trifle overwrought, and had a
glass of brandy too much at a certain committee lunch.
Then there was a rather delicate operation in a hospital,
and though I&#8217;m not sure yet that I blundered, it
was suggested that I did, and the thing was complicated
by what the woman said when the committee took it
up. It didn&#8217;t matter that the patient recovered, for
when he took action against the woman, the thing made
a sensation in the Eastern papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at Nasmyth with a question in his eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you more or less understand my
reasons for ranching here. How&#8217;s it going to affect you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth gazed reflectively towards the East. &#8220;I
think,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;there are more of us who have left
a good deal behind back yonder. Perhaps it&#8217;s fortunate
that the thing is possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he swung his axe again, and Gordon, who saw
Waynefleet approaching, strolled away towards the ranch-owner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>LAURA WAYNEFLEET&#8217;S WISH</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a hot summer evening, and a drowsy, resinous
fragrance stole out of the shadowy bush when Nasmyth,
who had now spent six months at Waynefleet&#8217;s
ranch, lay among the wineberries by the river-side. Across
the strip of sliding water the sombre firs rose in a great
colonnade from the grey rock&#8217;s crest, with the fires of
sunset blazing behind their wide-girthed trunks. The
river was low and very clear, and the sound of it seemed
to intensify the solemn stillness of the Bush. Nasmyth
had come there to fish, after a long day of tolerably
arduous labour, but he did not expect much success,
though the trout rise freely just after sunset in those
rivers. Indeed, he had almost forgotten that the rod
and net lay near his side, for his employer&#8217;s daughter
sat on a fallen cedar not far away from him.</p>
<p>She had laid her hat aside, and, as it happened, two
humming-birds that flashed, bejewelled, in a ray of ruddy
light hung poised on invisible wings about the clustered
blossoms of an arrow-bush that drooped above her head.
She was, however, not looking at them, but watching
Nasmyth with thoughtful eyes. Everything she wore
was the work of her own fingers, but the light print
dress became her curiously well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been here six months now,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; answered Nasmyth, with a little laugh. &#8220;I
almost venture to think I do you credit, in view of the
state I was in when I reached the ranch. If you hadn&#8217;t
taken me in hand, two or three days would probably
have been the length of my stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl made no disclaimer. She was one who admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
facts, even when they did not chime with her
wishes, and she still regarded Nasmyth thoughtfully.
He certainly did her credit, so far as his physical appearance
went, for his strength had fully come back to
him, and, as he lay among the wineberries in an easy
pose, his thin duck garments displayed the fine proportions
of a figure that had been trained almost to muscular
perfection by strenuous labour. The light of the
paling sunset was on his bronzed face, and it revealed
the elusive delicacy that characterized it. Nasmyth was
certainly a well-favoured man, but there were respects
in which his companion was not altogether satisfied with
him. She had, as she admitted, restored him to bodily
health, but, after all, that was only going so far, and she
felt it was possible that she might accomplish a little
more, though there was no very evident reason why she
should wish to do so. Still, she was conscious of the
wish.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering,&#8221; she said, &#8220;how long you would
be content to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth gazed at her in evident astonishment.
&#8220;Stay!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Oh, you can call it twenty
years, if one must be precise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; replied Laura, &#8220;in one sense, that is an admission
I&#8217;m not exactly pleased that you should make.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man raised himself slowly, and his face became
intent as he strove to grasp her meaning. He was
not in the least astonished that she should speak to him
as she did, for there are few distinctions drawn between
the hired man and those who employ him on the Pacific
slope, and he had discovered already that the girl was
at least his equal in intelligence and education. In fact,
he had now and then a suspicion that her views of life
were broader than his. In the meanwhile it was in one
respect gratifying to feel that she could be displeased at
anything he might think or do.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure I see the drift of that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be content to continue a ranch-hand
indefinitely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Nasmyth asked, with a smile.</p>
<p>Laura once more looked at him with an almost disconcerting
steadiness, and she had, as he was already
aware, very fine eyes. She, however, noticed the suggestive
delicacy of his face, which had, as it happened,
more than once somewhat displeased her, and a certain
languidness of expression, with which she had also grown
almost impatient. This man, she had decided, was too
readily acquiescent.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;is rather a big question, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Nasmyth reflectively. &#8220;Now I begin to
understand. Well, I don&#8217;t mind admitting that I once
had ambitions and the means of gratifying them, as well
as an optimistic belief in myself. That, however, was
rudely shattered when the means were withdrawn, and
a man very soon learns of how little account he is in
Western Canada. Why shouldn&#8217;t I be content to live
as the ranch-hands do, especially when it&#8217;s tolerably
evident that I can&#8217;t do anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are forgetting that most of them were born to
it. That counts for a good deal. Have you noticed
how far some of the others drift?&#8221; A faint trace of
heightened colour crept into her cheeks. &#8220;Perhaps one
couldn&#8217;t blame them when they have once acquired the
whisky habit and a Siwash wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth lay very still for a few moments, resting
on one elbow among the wineberries, for she had, after
all, only suggested a question that had once or twice
troubled him. It was, however, characteristic of him
that he had temporized, and, though he knew it must
be answered some day, had thrust it aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;you want to send me away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Now, I had almost fancied I had made things easier in
various ways for you, and we have been good comrades,
haven&#8217;t we? One could call it that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Laura slowly; &#8220;I think one could call
it that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; returned Nasmyth, &#8220;why do you want me
to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was difficult to answer, and, to begin with, Laura
did not exactly know she desired him to leave the ranch&ndash;&ndash;in
fact, she was willing to admit that there were several
reasons why she wished him to stay. Still, perhaps
because she had watched over him in his sickness, and,
so Gordon said, had snatched him back to life again, she
had a certain pride in him, and vaguely felt that. In one
sense, he belonged to her. She would not have him
throw away the life she had saved, and she had recognized,
as many of his English friends had not, the
perilously acquiescent side of his character. He was, she
feared, one who had an unfortunate aptitude for drifting.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is rather more than I could explain
either to myself or to you, but I will tell you something.
They are going to build the pulp-mill down the
valley, and they are now asking for tenders for the construction
of the dam. The thing, I have heard, is not
big enough to interest contractors from the cities, and
most of the men round here have their hands full with
their ranches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth became a trifle more intent. &#8220;Still,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;I have never built a dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me you were rather a good chopper, and
I think you are. You have made roads, too, and know
how to handle giant-powder in the rock-cutting, and how
to use the drill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are shoals of men in this country who know
considerably more about those things than I do.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>Laura made a little impatient gesture. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she
admitted, &#8220;there are, but they are simple Bushmen for
the most part; and does intellect count for nothing at
all? Are a trained understanding and a quick comprehension
of no use when one builds a dam?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth frowned, though she saw a little glow kindle
in his eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m by no means sure that I possess any
of those desirable qualities. Besides, there&#8217;s a rather serious
objection&ndash;&ndash;that of finance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Laura Waynefleet made it clear that she had
considered the question, and she favoured the man with a
glimpse of the practical side of her character.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stores give long credit, and partial payments
are generally made as a work of that kind goes on.
Then it is not a very unusual thing for workmen to wait
for their wages until the contract is carried through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth lay still for at least another minute. He
had gradually lost his ambition during the few years he
had wandered through the Bush of British Columbia.
The aimless life was often hard, but it had its compensations,
and he had learned to value its freedom from responsibility
and care. When he did not like a task he
had undertaken, he simply left it and went on again.
Still, he had had misgivings now and then when he
noticed how far some of his comrades had drifted. Presently
he rose slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re right, I think, and, if I&#8217;m
given an opportunity, I&#8217;ll undertake the thing. The
credit will be yours if I&#8217;m successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl rose. &#8220;Then,&#8221; she admonished, with a faint
smile, &#8220;don&#8217;t tell me that you have failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned away and left him somewhat abruptly,
but Nasmyth did not resume his fishing, though he
could hear the big trout splashing in the pool as the
sunset light faded off the water. He lay down among
the wineberries, which were scattered among the glossy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
leaves like little drops of blood, to think harder than he
had thought for a considerable time. An hour ago, as
he had told Laura Waynefleet, he would have been well
content to stay on at the ranch, and, though she had
roused him, he knew that it would cost him an effort to
leave it. He was not, he fancied, in love with her. Indeed,
he now and then admitted that she would probably
look for more from the man who won her favour than
there was in him, but the camaraderie&ndash;&ndash;he could think
of no better word for it&ndash;&ndash;that had existed between them
had been very pleasant to him.</p>
<p>He realized that he was in one sense hers to dispose
of. She had, in all probability, saved his life, and now
she was endeavouring to arouse his moral responsibility.
She was sending him out to play a man&#8217;s part in the
battle of life. He admitted that he had shrunk from it,
of late, or, at least, had been content to sink back among
the rank and file. He had made the most of things,
but that, he was beginning to realize, was, after all, a
somewhat perilous habit. Laura Waynefleet evidently
considered that a resolute attempt to alter conditions was
more becoming than to accept them, even though one
was likely to be injured while making it. He heard footsteps,
and, looking up, saw Gordon sit down upon the
cedar-log.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to look at Wiston&#8217;s hand, and walked across
when I heard that Waynefleet hadn&#8217;t been about,&#8221; he
explained. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need feel any particular
anxiety about your employer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth grinned at this. Waynefleet had spent part
of one day chopping a big balsam, and was apparently
feeling the effects of the very unusual exertion. Then
Gordon took out his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re fishing?&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came here to get a trout for breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like it.&#8221; Gordon smiled. &#8220;As it happened,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
I saw Miss Waynefleet crossing the clearing. It
occurs to me that she may have said something that set
you thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Nasmyth reflectively, &#8220;what made
you fancy that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon regarded him with a little twinkle in his eyes.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I have the honour of Miss Waynefleet&#8217;s
acquaintance, and have some little knowledge of
her habits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Men make friends with one another quickly in the
Western forests, and Nasmyth had acquired a curious
confidence in his companion, in spite of the story Gordon
had told him. As the result of this he related
part, at least, of what the girl had said. Gordon
nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite likely you&#8217;ll get that contract if you apply
for it. The folks about the settlement haven&#8217;t sent an
offer in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The notion is naturally Miss
Waynefleet&#8217;s. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that would appeal
to her, and, in a way, it&#8217;s fortunate you have fallen into
her hands. She&#8217;s one of the protesters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The protesters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Gordon; &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a better
name for them, though it doesn&#8217;t exactly convey all I
mean. To make the thing a little clearer, we&#8217;ll take the
other kind&ndash;&ndash;in this country they&#8217;re best typified by the
Indians. The Siwash found it a wilderness, and made
the most of it as such. They took their toll of the
salmon, and fed their ponies on the natural prairie grass.
If we&#8217;d left it to them for centuries it would have remained
a wilderness. We came, and found Nature omnipotent,
but we challenged her&ndash;&ndash;drove the steel road
down the great ca&ntilde;on to bring us provisions in, dyked
the swamp meadows, ploughed up the forest, and rent
the hills. We made our protest, and, quite often, it was
no more than that, for the rivers were too strong for us,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
and the Bush crept back upon our little clearings. Still,
we never let go, and it&#8217;s becoming evident that we have
done more than hold our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, and laughed in a deprecatory fashion
before he went on again. &#8220;Now and then I have an
outbreak of this kind,&#8221; he added lightly. &#8220;The thing
would make an epic, but, if one could write it, it
wouldn&#8217;t be worth while. The protest that counts in
this land is made with the axe and drill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outbreak was comprehensible, for it must be remembered
that the average Westerner, either by birth
or adoption, is seldom a reticent man. He is, in fact,
usually characterized by a daring optimism, and not infrequently
filled to overflowing with the clean pride of
achievement. One can hear this new-world enthusiasm
bubble over on public platforms and at brilliant functions,
as well as in second-rate saloons, but it is most
forcibly expressed where men toil waist-deep in icy water
building dyke and dam, or blast their waggon roads out
of the side of the gloomy ca&ntilde;ons. Their handiwork is
not always beautiful, but one wonders to see what they
have made of that great desolation.</p>
<p>Nasmyth lay still among the wineberries, for a minute
or two, and, though a cold green transparency had replaced
the fires of sunset behind the tall trunks now, and
the trout were splashing furiously in the pool, he forgot
all about the rod beside him as he pondered over a
question which had often occurred to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it that Miss Waynefleet is content to stay
here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would hardly expect her to leave her father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;Any way, that is scarcely
an answer. What keeps Waynefleet here? One wouldn&#8217;t
fancy he likes living in the Bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little curious that you haven&#8217;t heard. Anyway,
somebody is bound to tell you. Waynefleet had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
to get out of the Old Country. Some trouble about
trust-money. He came out to Victoria and set up in
the land agency business, but it was his misfortune that
he couldn&#8217;t keep out of politics. There are folks like
that. When they can&#8217;t handle their own affairs, they&#8217;re
anxious to manage those of the community. Somebody
found out the story and flung it in his face. The
man hadn&#8217;t the grit in him to live it down; he struck
up into the Bush and bought the half-cleared ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the next minute or two Nasmyth gazed straight
in front of him with a very thoughtful face, for he had
now a vague recollection of hearing or reading of the
affair in which his employer had played a discreditable
part. He had already decided that he was not in love
with Laura Waynefleet&ndash;&ndash;in fact, it was perhaps significant
that he had done so more than once, but he
had a warm regard for the girl who had saved his life,
and, after all, his ideas were not quite so liberal as he
fancied they had become in the Western forest. It was
a trifle disconcerting to discover that she was the daughter
of a swindler.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hurts?&#8221; inquired Gordon dryly.</p>
<p>Nasmyth rose. &#8220;To be frank,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;it does.
Still, though the subject&#8217;s a rather delicate one, I don&#8217;t
want you to misunderstand me. After all, Miss Waynefleet
is not in the least responsible for anything her father
may have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;is a sure thing. Well, I must
be hitting the trail home. Aren&#8217;t you going to try for
some of those trout in the pool?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth, and his smile was a trifle
grim; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched Gordon stride away through the undergrowth,
and then, in the creeping dusk, went slowly
back to the ranch. Waynefleet was out when he reached
it, but Laura was sitting sewing by the lamp, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
looked at him sharply when he came in. He was unpleasantly
conscious that the light was on his face. Then
the girl laid down her sewing and turned fully towards
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Mr. Gordon cross the clearing. He has told
you why we are living here?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Nasmyth, with a slowness that was
very expressive, &#8220;it was not done out of unkindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; and Laura smiled in a rather curious
fashion, &#8220;he had probably quite another motive.&#8221; Then
she leaned forward a little, looking at him steadily. &#8220;I
knew that he would tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth stood still, with his forehead deeply furrowed,
and an unusual gravity in his eyes. The girl&#8217;s
courage and serenity appealed to him, and he was conscious
that his heart was beating rapidly. He said nothing,
for a moment or two, and afterwards remembered
how still the little room was, and how the sweet, resinous
scent of the firs flowed in through the open window.
Then he made a vague gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is, perhaps, a good deal one could say; but
I fancy most of it would savour of impertinence,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;After all, the thing doesn&#8217;t affect you in any
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura glanced down at her hands, and Nasmyth
guessed what she was thinking, for they were hard, and
work-roughened. The toil that her hands showed was,
as he realized, only a part of her burden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it affects me a very great deal,&#8221; she declared
slowly.</p>
<p>Then a curious compassion for her troubled the man.
She was young and very comely, and it was, he felt,
cruelly hard on her that, bearing her father&#8217;s shame,
she must lead a life of hard labour at that desolate ranch.
He felt an almost uncontrollable desire to comfort her,
and to take her cares upon himself, but that was out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
of the question, since he was merely a ranch-hand, a
Bush-chopper, who owed even the food he ate and the
clothes he wore to her. There is, as he realized then,
after all, very little one can do to lighten another&#8217;s load,
but in that moment the half-formed aspirations that she
had called into existence in his mind expanded suddenly.
There was, he felt, no reason why he should not acquire
money and influence, once he made the effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Waynefleet,&#8221; he said haltingly, &#8220;I can only
offer you my sincere sympathy. Still&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and perhaps he
did not recognize how clear the connection of ideas was&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
am going down to see about that dam-building
contract to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Laura smiled, and took up her sewing again.
Her burden, as she realized, was hers alone, but she
knew that this man would no longer drift. She had
called up his latent capacities, and he would prove his
manhood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE FLOOD</h3>
</div>
<p>The autumn afternoon was oppressively hot when
Gordon, floundering among the whitened driftwood
piled along the river-bank, came upon Nasmyth, who
lay upon a slope of rock, with his hands, which were
badly bruised, clenched upon a drill. Another man, who
stood upon a plank inserted into a crevice, swung a hammer,
and its ponderous head came ringing down upon
the drill, which Nasmyth jerked round at every stroke,
so many times to the minute, with rhythmic regularity.
As Nasmyth was apparently too busily engaged just
then to trouble about him, Gordon sat down on a big
log, and taking out his pipe, looked about him when he
had lighted it.</p>
<p>The river had made a gap for itself in the great forest
that filled the valley, and the sombre firs that rose in
serried ranks upon its farther bank rolled back up the
hillside, streaked here and there with a little thin white
mist. A mile or so away, and lower down the valley,
there was an opening in their shadowy masses, out of
which rose the ringing of hammers and a long trail of
smoke, for workmen from the cities were building the
new wood-pulp mill there. In the foreground the
river swirled by, frothing at flood level, for a week&#8217;s
fierce sunshine had succeeded a month of torrential rain,
and the snow high up on a distant peak was melting
fast.</p>
<p>Nobody about the little settlement at the head of the
deep inlet had seen the water quite so high at that season,
and Gordon noticed how it frothed and boiled about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
row of stone-backed piles that stretched out from either
bank. As he listened to the hoarse roar of the pent-up
torrent, he understood what that partly completed dam
must have cost Nasmyth. After a little time Nasmyth
rose, and, stepping on the plank, wearily straightened his
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re down far enough,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Let me
have the two sticks of giant-powder, and then tell the
boys to jump for cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man, who sprang down from his perch,
handed him what appeared to be two thick sticks of
yellow wax, and Gordon watched him as he carefully
nipped a copper detonator down on a length of snaky
fuse, and embedded it in the plastic material. Then
he cautiously tamped the two yellow rolls down into the
drilled-out hole. After that he lighted the fuse, and,
clambering down the slope of rock, saw Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get out of this. It&#8217;s a short fuse,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gordon, who was acquainted with the action of giant-powder,
had no desire to stay, and they floundered as
fast as possible over the driftwood and masses of shattered
rock until Nasmyth drew his companion behind a
towering fir. Then there was a sharp detonation, a
crash, and a shower of flying stones went smashing
through the forest and into the river. One, which Gordon
fancied must have weighed about two hundred
pounds, drove close past them, and struck a young cedar,
which snapped off beneath the impact. Then there was
a sudden silence, and Nasmyth stretched out his arms
with a suggestive weariness before he sat down and took
out his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one could have expected that stone to come this
way,&#8221; he remarked, with a little laugh. &#8220;It&#8217;s an example
of how contrary things can be. In fact, they&#8217;ve been
about as contrary as it&#8217;s possible the last month or so.
As no doubt you have noticed, one very seldom gets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
much encouragement when he takes the uphill trail. It&#8217;s
very rarely made any easier for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon grinned, though he realized that the trail his
companion had set out upon was very steep indeed. He
had secured the dam-building contract, which was not
astonishing, since nobody else appeared anxious to undertake
it, and he had already acquired a certain proficiency
with the axe and drill. There is as yet very little specialization
in that land, which is in many respects fortunate
for those who live in it, and the small rancher cheerfully
undertakes any kind of primitive engineering that
seems likely to provide him with a few dollars, from
building timber bridges to blasting waggon roads out of
the hardest rock. What is more, he usually makes a success
of it. In Nasmyth&#8217;s case, however, the rise of water
had made his task almost insuperably difficult, and it had
already left a certain mark on him. Gordon, who was,
after all, a doctor, naturally noticed this as he watched
him.</p>
<p>Nasmyth was very lean now, but he was also hard
and muscular, and the old blue shirt, which hung open
at the neck, and torn duck trousers, which clung about
him still wet with river-water, accentuated the wiry
suppleness of his frame; but it was in his face that Gordon
noticed the greatest change. The good-humoured,
tolerant indifference he remembered had melted out of
it, the lips seemed set more firmly, and the eyes were
resolute and keen. Nasmyth, so Gordon noticed, had
grown since he first took up his duties as Waynefleet&#8217;s
hired hand. Still, though it was less apparent, the stamp
of refinement and what Gordon called, for want of a
better term, &#8220;sensibility,&#8221; clung to him, and it seemed
to the trained observer that the qualities it suggested
might yet handicap his comrade in a country where the
struggle with primitive forces chiefly demands from man
an unreasoning animal courage. In that land the small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
contractor and Bush-rancher must bear the brunt on
his body every day, toiling waist-deep in icy waters, or
gripping the drill with bleeding hands, while each fresh
misfortune that follows flood and frost is met with a
further strain on weary muscles and sterner resolution.
It is a fight that is usually hardest for the man who
thinks, and in which the one thing that counts is the
brutal, bulldog valour that takes hold and holds on in
spite of each crushing blow.</p>
<p>&#8220;This high water,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;has kept you back
considerably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has,&#8221; Nasmyth replied with emphasis. &#8220;It has
cost me more money that I care to figure up the last
month, and we&#8217;re considerably behind. The dam&#8217;s still
at the mercy of the next big flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little curious that you seem to stand it better
than you did the logging,&#8221; said Gordon, with a quick
glance at him.</p>
<p>Nasmyth appeared to consider this. &#8220;I do, and that&#8217;s
a fact. For one thing, I&#8217;m fighting for my own hand,
and no doubt that counts, though, perhaps, it doesn&#8217;t go
quite far enough. After all, it&#8217;s a point you ought to
know more about than I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>His companion smiled. &#8220;I can describe the mechanical
connection between the thought in a man&#8217;s brain and
the movement of his muscles. It&#8217;s comparatively simple;
but when you understand that, you&#8217;re only beginning.
There&#8217;s much more behind. To particularize, if you had
done what you&#8217;re doing now when you were logging, it
would, in all probability, have broken you up again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth fancied that this was correct, though, as he
had admitted, he could give no reason for it. He was
only conscious that he was being constrained by some
new influence, and, under the pressure it laid upon him,
he became almost insensible to physical weariness. He
had now a motive for fighting, in place of drifting, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
no mere hired hand can possess. His indolent content
had been rudely dissipated, and something that had lain
dormant in the depths of his nature had come uppermost.
It was certainly Laura Waynefleet who had given it the
first impulse, but why he had permitted her to impose
her will on him was a matter that was still incomprehensible
to him. Seeing that he did not answer, Gordon
changed the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the boys and I have been wondering how
you contrived to finance the thing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled, though there was just a trace of
darker colour in his face. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;one can
get tolerably long credit from most of the Bush stores,
and Clipton has let me have provisions for the boys on
quite reasonable terms. Besides, as it happens, there is
money in the family. There was a time when one might
have considered it almost the duty of certain relatives of
mine to give me a lift, but I didn&#8217;t offer them the opportunity.
I came out here and set about driving cows
and chopping trees instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You felt you&#8217;d sooner cut your hand off than give
them a gentle hint,&#8221; remarked Gordon. &#8220;It&#8217;s not an
uncommon feeling, but, when you give way to it, it clears
the other people. Won&#8217;t you go on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I undertook this affair, I laid the opportunity
before them, and one&ndash;&ndash;the last I expected anything of that
kind from&ndash;&ndash;sent me out a draft. He kindly pointed out
that there appeared to be in me certain capabilities, which
he had never supposed I possessed, and added that, if I
ever really succeeded in building a dam or anything else
useful, he would be pleased to take a share in my next
venture. In the meanwhile, he would charge me interest
on the amount of that draft. Perhaps I may mention
that the man in question was naturally the one the rest
of them rather looked down upon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon laughed. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I like that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
naturally. I guess you would have taken their view of
him once. Well, since you can put your pride in your
pocket, you&#8217;re evidently growing. There&#8217;s just one way
of putting anything through here, and that&#8217;s to take hold
and hang right on, no matter what it costs. I guess
there&#8217;s one of the boys wanting you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A man stood knee-deep in the river waving his hand.
Nasmyth rose and stretched himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to want me all the time from sun-up until
it&#8217;s dark,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In one way it&#8217;s a little curious,
since there&#8217;s reason to believe that most of them know a
good deal more about what we&#8217;re doing than I do myself.
You&#8217;ll excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon smiled as his comrade strode away. He was
one who had studied human nature, and because he was
well acquainted with the Bushman&#8217;s capabilities, he knew
that there were also limitations to them. Even in such
matters as the splitting of hard rock and the driving of
massive piles into the river-bed, the higher intelligence
of the man of intellect had its effect. Gordon smoked
his pipe out as he watched Nasmyth flounder into the
stream among the other men, pushing a little car loaded
with broken rock that apparently ran along a submerged
track. Then he strolled back toward the
settlement.</p>
<p>Nasmyth toiled on in the river until the camp-cook
hammered upon a suspended iron sheet as a signal that
supper was ready. The summons was answered without
delay. With the water running from their clothing Nasmyth
and his men went back to the little log shanty.
One or two changed their dripping garments, but the
rest left their clothes to dry upon them, as their employer
did. When the plentiful, warm supper had been eaten,
Nasmyth went back to the little hut that served him as
store and sleeping quarters. A big, grizzled man from
Mattawa, Ontario, went in with him, and lounged upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
the table while he sat in his bunk, which was filled
with fresh spruce twigs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty well played out, and if I&#8217;m to work to-morrow,
I&#8217;ve got to sleep to-night,&#8221; said Nasmyth.</p>
<p>The grizzled axeman nodded. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he volunteered,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand watch. I was in the last two nights,
and I guess it&#8217;s up to me to see you through. We&#8217;re
going to have trouble, if one of those big logs fetches up
across the sluiceway. The river&#8217;s full of them, and she&#8217;s
risen &#8217;most a foot since sun-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth held up one hand, and both heard the deep
roar of frothing water that came in with the smell of
the firs through the open door. The Bush was very
still outside, and that hoarse, throbbing note flung back
by the rock slope and climbing pines filled the valley.
Nasmyth smiled grimly, for it was suggestive of the great
forces against which he had pitted his puny strength.
Then there was a crash, and, a few moments later, a
curious thud, and both men listened, intent and strung
up, until the turmoil of the river rose alone again.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big log,&#8221; said the older man. &#8220;She has gone
through the run. Guess we&#8217;ll get one by-and-by long
enough to jamb. Now, if you&#8217;d run out those wing-frames
I was stuck on, she&#8217;d have took them straight
through, every one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble was that I hadn&#8217;t the money, Mattawa,&#8221;
said Nasmyth dryly.</p>
<p>His companion nodded, for this was a trouble he could
understand. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;when you haven&#8217;t
got it you have to face the consequences. I&#8217;ll roust you
out if a big log comes along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa went out, and soon afterwards Nasmyth,
whose clothes were now partly dry, lay down, dressed
as he was, in his twig-packed bunk, with his pipe in his
hand. It was growing a little colder, and a keen air,
which had in it the properties of an elixir, blew in, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
that was a thing Nasmyth scarcely noticed, and the dominant
roar of the river held his attention. He wondered
again why he had been drawn into the conflict with it,
or, rather, why he had permitted Laura Waynefleet to
set him such a task, and the answer that it was because
he desired to hold her good opinion, and, as he had said,
to do her credit, did not seem to go far enough. It
merely suggested the further question why he should wish
to keep her friendship. Still, there was no disguising the
fact that, once he had undertaken the thing, it had got
hold of him, and he felt he must go on until his task was
successfully accomplished or he was crushed and beaten.
It seemed very likely, then, that utter defeat would be
his fate. While he pondered, the pipe fell from his
hand, and the river&#8217;s turmoil rang in deep pulsations
through his dreams. He was awakened suddenly by a
wet hand on his shoulder, and, scrambling out of his
bunk on the instant, he saw Mattawa with a lantern in
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Log right across the sluice-run,&#8221; said the watcher.
&#8220;More coming along behind it. They&#8217;ll sure get piling
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth did not remember that he gave any directions
when he sprang, half asleep, out of the shanty. The
roar of water had a different note in it, and the clangour
of the iron sheet one of the men was pounding rang
out harshly. A half-moon hung above the black pines,
and dimly-seen men were flitting like shadows toward the
waterside. They appeared to know what it was advisable
to do, but they stopped just a moment on the
edge of the torrent, for which nobody could have blamed
them. The water, streaked with smears of froth and
foam, swirled by, and there was a tumultuous white
seething where the flood boiled across the log in the midst
of the stream. The log blocked the gap left open to let
the driftwood through, and, as Nasmyth knew, great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
trees torn up in distant valleys were coming down with
the flood. It seemed to him that he could not reasonably
have expected to clear that obstacle with a battalion of
log-drivers, and he had only a handful of weary men.
Still the men went in, floundering knee-deep in the
flood, along the submerged pile of stone and clutching at
the piles that bound it to save themselves when the stream
threatened to sweep their feet from under them, until they
came to the gap where the great tree, rolling in the grip
of the torrent, thrashed its grinding branches against
the stone.</p>
<p>Then, though it was difficult to see how a man of
them found a foothold, or kept it on the heaving trunk,
the big axes flashed and fell, while a few shadowy figures
ran along the top of the log to attack the massy butt
across the opening. It would have been arduous labour
in daylight and at low-water, but these were men who
had faced the most that flood and frost could do. They
set about their task in the dark, for that land would
have been a wilderness still if the men in it had shown
themselves unduly careful of either life or limb.</p>
<p>The great branches yielded beneath the glinting blades,
and went on down river again, but Nasmyth, who felt
the axe-haft slip in his greasy hands, did not try to lead.
It was sufficient if he could keep pace with the rest of
the wood-choppers, which was, after all, a thing most
men, reared as he had been, would certainly not have
done. The lust of conflict was upon him that night,
and, balancing himself ankle-deep in water on the trunk
that heaved and dipped beneath him, he swung the trenchant
steel. He felt that he was pitted against great
primeval forces, and, with the gorged veins rising on his
forehead and the perspiration dripping from him, man&#8217;s
primitive pride and passions urged him to the struggle.</p>
<p>How long it was before they had stripped the tree
to a bare log he did not know, but twice, as they toiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
on, he saw a man splash into the river, and, rising in the
eddy beneath the submerged dam, crawl, dripping, out
again, and at length he found himself beside Mattawa,
whirling his axe above a widening notch, and keeping
rhythmic stroke. He knew he was acquitting himself
creditably then, for Mattawa had swung the axe since
he could lift it, and there are men, and mechanics, too,
who cannot learn to use it as the Bushmen do in a lifetime;
but he also knew that he could not keep pace with
his comrade very long. In the meanwhile, he held his
aching muscles to their task, and the gleaming blades
whirled high above their shoulders in the pale light of
the moon. As each left the widening gap the other came
shearing down.</p>
<p>The other men were now plying peevie and handspike
at the butt of the log, and he and Mattawa toiled on
alone, two dim and shadowy figures in the midst of the
flood, until at last there was a rending of fibres, and Mattawa
leapt clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;She&#8217;s going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth jumped. He went down in four or five feet
of water, and had the sense to stay there while the log
drove over him. Then he came up, and clutching it,
held on while it swept downstream into a slacker eddy.
There were several other figures apparently clinging to
the butt of it, and when he saw them slip off into the
river one by one, he let go, too. He was swung out of
the eddy into a white turmoil, which hurled him against
froth-lapped stones, but at length he found sure footing,
and crawled up the bank, which most of his companions
had reached before him. When the others came up, he
found that he was aching all over, and evidently was
badly bruised. He stood still, shivering a little, and
blinked at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all here?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where are those
axes?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>It appeared that most of them were in the river, which
was not very astonishing, for a man cannot reasonably
be expected to swim through a flood with a big axe in
his hand, and when somebody said so, Nasmyth made
a little gesture of resignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the logs will just have to pile up,
if another big one comes along before the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was evident. They were all dead weary, and
most of them were badly bruised, as well, and they
trooped back to the shanty, while Nasmyth limped into
his hut. Nasmyth sloughed off his dripping garments,
and was asleep in five minutes after he had crawled into
his bunk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE BREAKING OF THE DAM</h3>
</div>
<p>A faint grey light was creeping into the shanty
when Nasmyth awoke again, and lay still for a
minute or two, while his senses came slowly back to him.
The first thing of which he was definitely conscious was
a physical discomfort that rendered the least movement
painful. He felt sore all over, and there was a distressful
ache in one hip and shoulder, which he fancied was
the result of falling on the log, or perhaps of having
been hurled against the boulders by the rapids through
which he had reached the bank. His physical condition
did not trouble him seriously, for he had grown more or
less accustomed to muscular weariness, and the cramping
pains which spring from toiling long hours in cold water,
and, although he made a grimace, as he raised himself a
trifle, it was the sound outside that occupied most of
his attention.</p>
<p>The door stood open, as he had left it, and a clean,
cold air that stirred his blood came in, with the smell of
fir and cedar, but what he noticed was the deeper tone
in the roar of the river that seemed flung back in
sonorous antiphones by the climbing pines. It had occurred
to him on other occasions when he was in a
fanciful mood that they were singing a majestic <i>Benedicite</i>,
but just then he was uneasily conscious that there
was a new note in the great reverberating harmonies.
Stately pine and towering cedar had raised their voices,
too, and a wild wailing fell through the long waves of
sound from the highest of them on the crest of the hill.
It was evident that a fresh breeze was blowing down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
valley, and, as it must have swept the hollow farther
up among the ranges, which was filled with a deep blue
lake, Nasmyth realized that it would drive at least another
foot of water into the river as well as set adrift
the giant logs that lay among the boulders. Even then
they were, he fancied, in all probability driving down
upon his half-finished dam.</p>
<p>Rousing himself with an effort, he clambered out of
his bunk, and then gripped the little table hard, for his
hip pained him horribly as his weight came upon it.
Then, as he struggled into his clothing, there was a
heavy thud outside, that was followed by a crashing and
grinding, and a gasping man appeared in the door of the
shanty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big log across the run,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;three or four
more of them coming along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth, who said nothing, set his lips tight, and
was out of the shanty in another moment or two.
A glance at the river showed him that any effort he could
make would, in all probability, be futile; but he and
the others waded out into the flood and recommenced
the struggle. That, at least, was a thing they owed to
themselves, and they toiled for an hour or two very much
as they had done in the darkness; only that fresh logs
were now coming down on them every few minutes,
and at last they recognized that they were beaten. Then
they went back dejectedly, and Nasmyth sat down to
breakfast, though he had very little appetite. He felt
that all the strength he had would be needed that day.</p>
<p>After breakfast he lay among the boulders gnawing
his unlighted pipe and watching the growing mass of
driftwood that chafed and ground against the piles of
the dam. Nothing, he recognized, could save the dam
now. It was bound to go, for the piles were only partly
backed with stone, and, in any case, men do not build in
that new country as they do in England. Their needs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
are constantly varying, and their works are intended
merely to serve the purpose of the hour. It is a growing
country, and the men in it know that the next generation
will not be content with anything that they can
do, and, what is more to the purpose, they themselves
will want something bigger and more efficient in another
year or two. Hence the dam was a somewhat frail and
temporary structure of timber as well as stone, but it
would probably have done what was asked of it had it
been completed before the floods set in. As it was,
Nasmyth knew that he would see the end of it before
another hour slipped by.</p>
<p>It came even sooner than he had expected. There
was a dull crash; the piles that rose above the flood
collapsed, and the mass of grinding timber drove on
across the ruined dam. Then Nasmyth rose, and,
stretching himself wearily, went back to his shanty.
He felt he could not face the sympathy of his workmen.
He was still sitting there in a state of utter physical
weariness and black dejection, when, towards the middle
of the afternoon, the door was quietly opened, and Laura
Waynefleet came in. She looked at him as he remembered
she had done once or twice at the ranch, with
compassion in her eyes, and he was a little astonished
to feel that, instead of bringing him consolation, her
pity hurt him. Then he felt the blood rise to his face,
and he looked away from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have heard already?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the girl softly. &#8220;I was at the settlement,
and they told me there. I am so sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth winced, but he contrived to say, &#8220;Thank
you,&#8221; and then glanced round the untidy shanty, which
was strewn with dripping clothes. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;it is something to know that I have your sympathy;
but I must not keep you here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a tactful speech, but Laura smiled. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
meant to take you out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have been sitting
here brooding since the dam went, and from what
Mattawa told me, you haven&#8217;t had any dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nasmyth; &#8220;now I come to think of it, I
don&#8217;t believe I have. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s very astonishing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll go away somewhere and make tea among
the pines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced suggestively at his attire. His duck
jacket had shrunk with constant wetting, and would not
button across the old blue shirt, which fell apart at his
bronzed neck. The sleeves had also drawn up from his
wrists, and left the backs of his hands unduly prominent.
His hands were scarred, and the fingers were bruised
where the hammer-head had fallen on them in wet
weather as it glanced from the drill. The girl was
immaculate in a white hat and a dress of light flowered
print.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look like going on a picnic with you?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;The few other things I possess are in much the same
condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura had naturally noticed the state of his attire,
but it was his face that troubled her. It was haggard
and his eyes were heavy. As she had decided long before,
it was a face of Grecian type, and she would sooner
have had it Roman. This man, she felt, was too sensitive,
and apt to yield to sudden impulses, and just then
her heart ached over him. Still, she contrived to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I told Mattawa to get me a
few things ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth followed her out of the shanty, and when
he had picked up the basket and kettle somebody had
left at the door, she turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall we go?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;that is, as long as it&#8217;s
away from the river.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>Laura saw the shrinking in his eyes as he gazed at
the swirling flood, and though she was sorry for him,
it roused in her a momentary spark of anger. Then
she went with him up the hillside beneath the climbing
pines until they reached a shadowy hollow near the crest
of it, out of which a little stream trickled down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now light a fire, while I see what there is in the
basket,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She found a splendid trout, a packet of tea, and a
little bag of self-raising flour, among other sundries,
and for the next half-hour she kept Nasmyth busy making
flapjacks and frying the trout. Then they sat down
to a simple meal, and when it was over, Nasmyth
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little astonishing, in view of how I felt at
breakfast, but there&#8217;s nothing left,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;In one
way the admission&#8217;s a little humiliating, but I almost
feel myself again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s supposed to be a very natural one in the case
of a man,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;You can smoke if you like.
I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth stretched himself out on the other side of
the fire, and Laura, leaning forward a little, looked at
him. Without knowing exactly why, he felt somewhat
uneasy beneath her gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I would like to hear what you are
going to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man made a little rueful gesture. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know. Chop trees again for some rancher, most probably&ndash;&ndash;in
fact, I was wondering whether you would have
me back as a ranch-hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried the girl sharply, while a trace of hardness
crept into her eyes, &#8220;that is very much what I expected.
As it happens, I am far from satisfied with the
man we have, but I should not think of replacing him
with you just now.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth winced, and it was characteristic of him that
he endeavoured to beguile her away from the object she
evidently had in view.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the man?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;A diversity of gifts. Among other things, he appears
to possess an extensive acquaintance with Colonial
politics, and he and my father discuss the regeneration
of the Government when they might with advantage be
doing something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth frowned. &#8220;I understand. That&#8217;s one
reason why I wanted to come back. After all, there is
a good deal I could save you from. In fact, I get savage
now and then when I think of what you are probably
being left to do upon the ranch. I ventured a hint
or two to your father, but he seemed impervious.&#8221; He
hesitated for a moment. &#8220;No doubt it&#8217;s a delicate subject,
but it&#8217;s a little difficult quietly to contemplate the
fact that, while those men talk politics, you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do their work?&#8221; suggested Laura with a lifting
of her arched eyebrows. &#8220;After all, isn&#8217;t that or something
like it what generally happens when men turn
their backs upon their task?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth flushed. &#8220;I admit that I was trying to
break away from mine, but it seems you have undertaken
to head me off and drive me back to it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was more or less what I wished,&#8221; said Laura
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Nasmyth replied, &#8220;as I think you&#8217;re a little
hard on me, I&#8217;ll try to put my views before you. To
begin with, the dam is done for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite sure? You built it so far once. Is
it altogether out of the question for you to do as much
again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt his face grow hot. She was looking at
him with quiet eyes, which had, however, the faintest
suggestion of disdain in them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The question is why I should want to do it,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; rejoined Laura, &#8220;you have no aspirations at
all? Still, I&#8217;m not quite sure that is exactly what I
mean&ndash;&ndash;in fact, I think I mean considerably more. You
are quite content to throw away your birthright, and
relinquish all claim to the station you were born in?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man smiled somewhat bitterly. &#8220;I think you
understand that it&#8217;s a custom of this country not to demand
from any man an account of what he may have
done before he came out to it. In my particular case
it was, however, nothing very discreditable, and I once
had my aspirations, or, as you prefer to consider it, I
recognized my obligations. Then the blow fell unexpectedly,
and I came out here and became a hired man&ndash;&ndash;a
wandering chopper. After all, one learns to be content
rather easily, which is in several ways fortunate.
Then you instilled fresh aspirations&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s the right word
in this case&ndash;&ndash;into me, and I made another attempt, only
to be hurled back again. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be
much use in attempting the impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then a thing is to be considered impossible after
one fails twice? There are men who fail&ndash;&ndash;and go on
again&ndash;&ndash;all their lives long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; Nasmyth declared in a dull tone, &#8220;I
am not that kind of man. After all, to be flung down
from the station you were born to&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m using your own
words&ndash;&ndash;and turned suddenly adrift to labour with one&#8217;s
hands takes a good deal of the courage out of one. I
almost think if you could put yourself in my place you
would understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura smiled in a suggestive fashion, and looked
down at the hands she laid upon her knee. They
were capable, as well as shapely, and, as he had noticed
more than once, the signs of toil were very plain on
them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I never did an hour&#8217;s useful work before I came out
West,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She had produced the effect she probably desired, for
in the midst of his sudden pity for her Nasmyth was
troubled with a sense of shame. This girl, he realized,
had been reared as gently as he had been himself, and
he knew that she now toiled most of every day at what
in the older country would have been considered most
unwomanly tasks. Still, she had borne with it cheerfully,
and had courage to spare for others whose strength
was less than hers.</p>
<p>He sat silent for almost a minute, looking down between
the great pines into the valley, and, as he did so,
he vaguely felt the influence of the wilderness steal over
him. The wind had fallen now, and there was a deep
stillness in the climbing forest which the roar of the
river emphasized. Those trees were vast of girth, and
they were very cold. In spite of whirling snow, and gale,
and frost, they had grown slowly to an impressive stateliness.
In Nature, as he recognized, all was conflict,
and it was the fine adjustment of opposing forces that
made for the perfection of grace, and strength, and
beauty. Then it seemed to him that his companion was
like the forest&ndash;&ndash;still, and strong, and stately&ndash;&ndash;because
she had been through the stress of conflict too. These
were, however, fancies, and he turned around again to
her with a sudden resolution expressed in his face and
attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an argument you might have used, Miss
Waynefleet,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;I said I would try to do
you credit, and it almost seems as if I had forgotten it.
Well, if you will wait a little, I will try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose, and, crossing over, stood close beside her,
with his hand laid gently on her shoulder, looking down
on her with a quiet smile. &#8220;After all,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;there&#8217;s a good deal you might have said that you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
haven&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;in fact, it&#8217;s one of your strong points that, as
a rule, you content yourself with going just far enough.
Well, because you wish it, I am somehow going to build
that dam again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him swiftly with a gleam in her eyes,
and Nasmyth stooped a little, while his hand closed hard
upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saved my life, and you have tried to do almost
as much in a different way since then,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;It is probably easier to bring a sick man back to health
than it is to make him realize his obligations and to imbue
him with the courage to face them when it&#8217;s evident
that he doesn&#8217;t possess it. Still, you can&#8217;t do things of
that kind without results, and I think you ought to
know that I belong to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a trace of colour in Laura Waynefleet&#8217;s
face, and she quivered a little under his grasp, but she
looked at him steadily, and read his mind in his eyes.
The man was stirred by sudden, evanescent passion and
exaggerated gratitude, while pity for her had, she fancied,
also its effect on him; but that was the last thing she
desired, and, with a swift movement, she shook off his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said; &#8220;don&#8217;t spoil things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her tone was quiet, but it was decisive, and Nasmyth,
whose face flushed darkly, let his hand fall back to his
side. Then she rose, and turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are to be friends, this must never happen
again,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Then they went down the hillside and back to the
settlement, where Nasmyth harnessed the team, which
the rancher who lived near occasionally placed at Waynefleet&#8217;s
disposal, to a dilapidated waggon. When she
gathered the reins up, Laura smiled down on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she reminded him, &#8220;you will remember
that I expect you to do me credit.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>She drove away, and Nasmyth walked back to his
camp beside the dam, where the men were awaiting the
six o&#8217;clock supper. He leaned upon a pine-stump, looking
at them gravely, when he had called them together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the river, as you know, has wiped
out most of the dam. Now, it was a tight fit for me
to finance the thing, and I don&#8217;t get any further payment
until the stone-work&#8217;s graded to a certain level. Well,
if you leave me now, I&#8217;ve just enough money in hand to
square off with each of you. You see, if you go you&#8217;re
sure of your pay. If you stay, most of the money will
go to settle the storekeeper&#8217;s and the powder bills, and
should we fail again, you&#8217;ll have thrown your time away.
I&#8217;d like you to understand the thing; but whether you
stay or not, I&#8217;m holding on.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for half a minute, and then the men,
gathering into little groups, whispered to one another,
until Mattawa stood forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you have to do is to go straight ahead. We&#8217;re
coming along with you solid&ndash;&ndash;every blame one of us,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>A red flush crept into Nasmyth&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, boys. After that I&#8217;ve got to put this
contract through,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>LAURA MAKES A DRESS</h3>
</div>
<p>The frost had grown keener as darkness crept over
the forest, and the towering pines about the clearing
rose in great black spires into the nipping air, but it was
almost unpleasantly hot in the little general room of
Waynefleet&#8217;s ranch. Waynefleet, who was fond of
physical comfort, had gorged the snapping stove, and
the smell of hot iron filled the log-walled room. There
was also a dryness in its atmosphere which would probably
have had an unpleasant effect upon anyone not used
to it. The rancher, however, did not appear to feel it.
He lay drowsily in a big hide chair, and his old velvet
jacket and evening shoes were strangely out of harmony
with his surroundings. Waynefleet made it a rule to
dress for the six o&#8217;clock meal, which he persisted in calling
dinner.</p>
<p>He had disposed of a quantity of potatoes and apples
at the settlement of late, and had now a really excellent
cigar in his hand, while a little cup of the Mocha coffee,
brought from Victoria for his especial use, stood on the
table beside him. Waynefleet had cultivated tastes,
and invariably gratified them, when it was possible,
while it had not occurred to him that there was anything
significant in the fact that his daughter confined
herself to the acrid green tea provided by the settlement
store. He never did notice a point of that kind, and, if
anyone had ventured to call his attention to it, he would
probably have been indignant as well as astonished. As
a rule, however, nobody endeavours to impress unpleasant
facts upon men of Waynefleet&#8217;s character. In their
case it is clearly not worth while.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do you intend to go on with that dressmaking much
longer?&#8221; he asked petulantly. &#8220;The click of your
scissors has an irritating effect on me, and, as you may
have noticed, I cannot spread my paper on the table. It
cramps one&#8217;s arms to hold it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura swept part of the litter of fabric off the table,
and it was only natural that she did it a trifle abruptly.
She had been busy with rough tasks, from most of which
her father might have relieved her had he possessed
a less fastidious temperament, until supper, and there
were reasons why she desired an hour or two to
herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not be longer than I can help,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Waynefleet lifted his eyebrows sardonically as he
glanced at the scattered strips of fabric. &#8220;This,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;is evidently in preparation for that ridiculous
pulp-mill ball. In view of the primitive manners of
the people we shall be compelled to mix with, I really
think I am exercising a good deal of self-denial in consenting
to go at all. Why you should wish to do so is,
I confess, altogether beyond me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood that you considered it advisable to
keep on good terms with the manager,&#8221; said Laura, with
a trace of impatience. &#8220;He has bought a good deal of
produce from you to feed his workmen with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father made a gesture of resignation. &#8220;One
has certainly to put up with a good deal that is unpleasant
in this barbarous land&ndash;&ndash;in fact, almost everything
in it jars upon one,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;You, however,
I have sometimes wondered to notice, appear almost
content here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura looked up with a smile, but said nothing. She,
at least, had the sense and the courage to make the most
of what could not be changed. It was a relief to her
when, a minute or two later, the hired man opened the
door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve got the embrocation, I guess I&#8217;ll give that
ox&#8217;s leg a rub,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Waynefleet rose and turned to the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put on
my rubber overshoes,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;As I mentioned
that I might have to go out, it&#8217;s a pity you didn&#8217;t think
of laying out my coat to warm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura brought the overshoes, and he permitted her to
fasten them for him and to hold his coat while he put it
on, after which he went out grumbling, and she sat
down again to her sewing with a strained expression in
her eyes, for there were times when her father tried her
patience severely. She sighed as she contemplated the
partly rigged-up dress stretched out on the table, for she
could not help remembering how she had last worn it at
a brilliant English function. Then she had been flattered
and courted, and now she was merely an unpaid
toiler on the lonely ranch. Money was, as a rule, signally
scarce there, but even when there were a few dollars
in Waynefleet&#8217;s possession, it seldom occurred to him to
offer any of them to his daughter. It is also certain that
nobody could have convinced him that it was only
through her efforts he was able to keep the ranch going
at all. She never suggested anything of the kind to him,
but she felt now and then that her burden was almost
beyond her strength.</p>
<p>She quietly went on with her sewing. There was to
be a dance at the new pulp-mill, which had just been
roofed, and, after all, she was young, and could take a
certain pleasure in the infrequent festivities of her adopted
country. Besides, the forest ranchers dance well, and
there were men among them who had once followed
other occupations; while she knew that Nasmyth would
be there&ndash;&ndash;in fact, having at length raised his dam to the
desired level, he would be to a certain extent an honoured
guest. She was not exactly sure how she regarded
him, though it was not altogether as a comrade, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
felt there was, in one sense, some justice in his admission
that he belonged to her. She had, in all probability,
saved his life, and&ndash;&ndash;what was, perhaps, as much&ndash;&ndash;had
roused him from supine acquiescence, and inspired him
with a sustaining purpose. After the day when she had
saved him from abject despair over his ruined dam, he
had acquitted himself valiantly, and she had a quiet pride
in him. Moreover, she was aware of a natural desire to
appear to advantage at the approaching dance.</p>
<p>There was, however, difficulty to be grappled with.
The dress was old, and when remade in a later style
would be unfortunately plain. The few pairs of gloves
she had brought from England were stained and spotted
with damp, and her eyes grew wistful as she turned over
the stock list of a Victoria dry goods store. The thing
would be so easy, if she had only a little more money,
but she sighed as she glanced into her purse. Then she
took up the gloves and a strip of trimming, and looked
at them with a little frown, but while she did so there
were footsteps outside, and the door was opened. A
man, whom she recognized as a hired hand from a ranch
in the neighbourhood, stood in the entrance with a packet
in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t come in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I met Nasmyth down
at the settlement. He&#8217;d just come back from Victoria,
and he asked me to bring this along.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went away after he had handed her the packet,
and a gleam of pleasure crept into Laura&#8217;s eyes when
she opened it. There was first of all a box of gloves
of various colours, and then inside another packet a
wonderful piece of lace. The artistic delicacy of the lace
appealed to her, for though she possessed very few dainty
things she was fond of them, and she almost fancied
that she had not seen anything of the kind more beautiful
in England.</p>
<p>As she unfolded it a strip of paper fell out, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
warm blood swept into her face as she read the message
on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering everything, I really don&#8217;t think you
could regard it as a liberty,&#8221; it ran. &#8220;You have given
me a good deal more than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then for just a moment her eyes grew hazy. In
proportion to the man&#8217;s means, it was a costly gift, and,
except for him, nobody had shown her much consideration
since she had left England. She was a trifle perplexed,
for she did not think there was lace of that kind
on sale often in Victoria, and, in regard to the gloves,
it was not evident how he had known her size. Then she
remembered that one of the cotton ones she sometimes
wore had disappeared some little time before, and once
more the flush crept into her cheeks. That almost decided
her not to wear his lace, but she felt that to refrain
from doing so would raise the question as to how they
stood with regard to one another, which was one she did
not desire to think out closely then; and, after all, the
lace was exactly what she wanted to complete the dress.
She rolled it together, and put it and the gloves away,
but she treasured the little note.</p>
<p>It was a week later when her father drove her to the
pulp-mill in a jolting waggon, and arrived there a little
earlier than he had expected. A dance usually begins
with a bountiful supper in that country, but Waynefleet,
who was, as a rule, willing to borrow implements
or teams from his Bush neighbours, would seldom eat
with them when he could help it. He was accordingly
not quite pleased to find the supper had not yet been cleared
away, but Laura, who understood what he was feeling,
contrived to lead him into a vacant place at one of the
tables. Then she sat down, and looked about her.</p>
<p>The great room was hung with flags and cedar boughs,
and the benches down the long uncovered tables were
crowded. The men&#8217;s attire was motley&ndash;&ndash;broadcloth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
and duck; white shirts, starched or limp, and blue ones;
shoes with the creeper-spikes filed down, and long boots
to the knees. There were women present also, and they
wore anything from light print, put together for the occasion,
to treasured garments made in Montreal or Toronto
perhaps a dozen years before, but for all that the
assembly was good to look upon. There was steadfast
courage in the bronzed faces, and most of those who sat
about the long tables had kindly eyes. The stamp of a
clean life of effort was upon them, and there was a certain
lithe gracefulness in the unconscious poses of the
straight-limbed men. There was no sign of limp slovenliness
about them. Even in their relaxation they were
intent and alert, and, as she watched them, Laura realized
something of their restless activity and daring optimism.
They believe in anything that is good enough in
that country, and are in consequence cheerfully willing
to attempt anything, even if to other men it would appear
altogether visionary and impossible, and simple
faith goes a long way when supplemented by patient
labour. Laura suddenly became conscious that the manager
of the pulp-mill, a little wiry man, in white shirt
and store clothes, was speaking at the head of the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one way, it&#8217;s not a very big thing we have done,
boys,&#8221; he said; and Laura was quick to notice the significance
of the fact, which was also characteristic of the
country, that he counted himself as one of them.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve chopped a hole in the primeval forest, held
back the river, and set up our mill. That&#8217;s about all on
the face of it, but there&#8217;s rather more behind. It&#8217;s another
round with Nature, and we&#8217;ve got her down again.
It&#8217;s a thing you have to do west of the Rockies, or she&#8217;ll
crush the life out of you. There are folks in the Eastern
cities who call her beneficent; but they don&#8217;t quite
understand what was laid on man in Eden long ago.
Here he&#8217;s up against flood and frost and snow. Well, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
guess we&#8217;ve done about all we can, and now that I&#8217;ve paid
my respects to the chopper and carpenter-gang, there&#8217;s another
man I want to mention. He took hold of the contract
to put us up our dam, and kept hold through the
blamedest kind of luck. There&#8217;s hard grit in him and
the boys he led, and the river couldn&#8217;t wash it out of
them. Well, when the big turbines are humming and
the mill&#8217;s grinding out money for all of you, I guess
you&#8217;re going to remember the boys who built the dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a shout which shook the wooden building,
and Laura sat very still when Nasmyth stood up. There
was no doubt that he was a favourite with everybody
there, and she knew that she had nerved him to the
fight. He did not appear altogether at ease, and she
waited with a curious expectancy for what he had to say.
It was very little, but she appreciated the tact which
made him use the speech his audience was accustomed to.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a good crowd,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With the boys I
had behind me I couldn&#8217;t back down.&#8221; Then his voice
shook a little. &#8220;Still, I was mighty near it once or
twice. It was the boys&#8217; determination to hold on&ndash;&ndash;and
another thing&ndash;&ndash;that put new grit in me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without being conscious of what he was doing, he
swept his glance down the long table until it rested on
Laura Waynefleet&#8217;s face. She felt the blood creep into
her cheeks, for she knew what he meant, but she looked
at him steadily, and her eyes were shining. Then he
spread his hands out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt I daren&#8217;t shame boys of that kind,&#8221; he said,
and hastily sat down.</p>
<p>His observations were certainly somewhat crude, but
the little quiver in his voice got hold of those who heard
him, and once more the big building rang with cheering.
As the sound of hearty acclamation died away there was
a great clatter of thrust-back benches through which the
tuning of a fiddle broke. Then out of the tentative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
twang of strings rose, clear and silvery, the lament of
Flora Macdonald, thrilling with melancholy, and there
were men and women there whose hearts went back to
the other wild and misty land of rock and pine and frothing
river which they had left far away across the sea.
It may be that the musician desired a contrast, or that
he was merely feeling for command of the instrument,
for the plaintive melody that ran from shift to shift into
a thin elfin wailing far up the sobbing strings broke off
suddenly, and was followed by the crisp jar of crashing
chords. Then &#8220;The Flowers of Edinburgh&#8221; rang out
with Caledonian verve in it and a mad seductive swing,
and the guests streamed out to the middle of the floor.
That they had just eaten an excellent supper was a matter
of no account with them.</p>
<p>Nasmyth, in the meanwhile, elbowed his way through
the crowd of dancers until he stood at Laura&#8217;s side, and
as he looked at her, there was a trace of embarrassment
in his manner. She wore his lace, but until that moment
her attire had never suggested the station to which she
had been born. Now she seemed to have stepped, fresh
and immaculate, untouched by toil, out of the world to
which he had once belonged. She was, for that night
at least, no longer an impoverished rancher&#8217;s daughter,
but a lady of station. With a twinkle in his eyes, he
made her a little formal inclination, and she, knowing
what he was thinking, answered with an old-world
curtsey, after which a grinning ox-teamster of habitant
extraction turned and clapped Nasmyth&#8217;s shoulder approvingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;V&#8217;la la belle chose!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mamselle Laura
is altogether ravissante. Me, I dance with no one else
if she look at me like dat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Nasmyth and Laura laughed, and glided into
the dance, though, in the case of most of their companions,
&#8220;plunged&#8221; would have been the better word for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
it. English reserve is not esteemed in that land, and
the axemen danced with the mingled verve of grey Caledonia
and light-hearted France, while a little man with
fiery hair from the misty Western Isles shrieked encouragement
at them, and maddened them with his fiddle.
Even Nasmyth and Laura gave themselves up to
the thrill of it, but as they swung together through the
clashing of the measure, which some of their companions
did not know very well, confused recollections
swept through their minds, and they recalled dances in
far different surroundings. Now and then they even fell
back into old tricks of speech, and then, remembering,
broke off with a ringing laughter. They were young
still, and the buoyancy of the country they had adopted
was in both of them.</p>
<p>The dance ended too soon, and, when the music broke
off with a crash of clanging chords, Nasmyth led his
partner out of the press into a little log-walled room
where the half-built dynamos stood. It was lighted, but
a sharp cool air and the fret of the river came in through
a black opening in one wall. Laura sat upon a large
deal case, and Nasmyth, looking down upon her, leaned
against a dynamo. He smiled as he recognized that she
grasped the significance of the throbbing roar of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very pleasant while it lasted, but&ndash;&ndash;and it&#8217;s
a pity&ndash;&ndash;the music has stopped,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What we
are now listening to is the turmoil of a Canadian river.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura laughed, though there was a wistfulness in her
eyes. &#8220;Oh, I understand, but couldn&#8217;t you have let me
forget it just for to-night?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I suppose that
privilege was permitted to Cinderella.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man felt curiously sorry for her as he remembered
how hard her life was at the lonely ranch, but he knew
she would not be pleased if he expressed his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he observed reflectively, &#8220;a thing often looks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
most attractive when it&#8217;s forbidden you, or a long way off,
and, you see, there are always compensations. In fact,
I&#8217;m beginning to come across quite a few of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment, and Laura, who noticed
that he looked at her, fancied she understood in what
direction his thoughts were drifting; but he went on
again with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there are exiles who realize
that they are in various ways better off than in all probability
they would have been had they stayed in the land
they were driven out of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; answered Laura, &#8220;would you go back if you
were given the opportunity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Nasmyth asserted slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I
should do that&ndash;&ndash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she understood him, the more clearly because
she saw by the slight wrinkling of his forehead, during
the significant pause, that he had grappled with the
question. She did not think he was altogether in love
with her, but she knew, at least, that he did not wish to
go away while she was left behind in Canada. It seemed
desirable to change the subject, and she touched the lace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to thank you for this,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It has
given me pleasure.&#8221; Then&ndash;&ndash;and the words were wholly
unpremeditated&ndash;&ndash;she added: &#8220;I wanted to look well&ndash;&ndash;just
for once&ndash;&ndash;to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was sorry, a moment later, when she saw the quick
change in the man&#8217;s expression, for she remembered that
they had always seemed to understand what the other
meant. It was clear that the qualification just for once
had not misled him, but, after all, it seemed to her that
he must presently realize that the admission was not
one a reticent woman really in love with him would
have made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are always beautiful.&#8221; Then his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
manner became deprecatory. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d
mind. In one way what I owe you makes me a privileged
person. I felt that I could venture&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>This, too, was clear to her, and though she considered
his attitude the correct one, it jarred a little upon her.
She was content that they should be merely comrades,
or, at least, that was what she had endeavoured to convince
herself, but, after all, there was no reason why he
should emphasize the fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied quickly, &#8220;I think I understand.&#8221;
Then once more she changed the subject. &#8220;I want to
compliment you on building the dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed, but there was a light in his eyes.
&#8220;I should never have built it, if it hadn&#8217;t been for you.
Still&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and he made her a reverent bow&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I owe you
a good deal more than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura made no response to this. She had thrilled at
his achievement, when she had heard the manager&#8217;s
speech, and it became still plainer that there was a certain
hazard in dwelling upon his success. She could also
be practical.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one way,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I suppose the result was not
quite so satisfactory?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly wasn&#8217;t. Of course, the work is not
quite completed yet, but after settling up everything, the
interim payment left me with about fifteen dollars in
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura was not astonished at this, but she was more
than a little perplexed, for she fancied that the lace she
was wearing must have cost a good deal more than fifteen
dollars. Still, she had no wish to make it evident that
he had been extravagant; and, while she considered the
matter, a man appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you two have got to come right out,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;What d&#8217;you figure you were asked here for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth held his arm out, but when Laura would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
have laid her hand upon it, the man broke in with a
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; he said severely, &#8220;Miss Waynefleet&#8217;s going
right round. Now you&#8217;re coming along with me, and
we&#8217;ll show them how to waltz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura smiled good-humouredly, and he swept her into
the dance, while Nasmyth was seized upon by a girl,
who drove him through it much as she did her brother&#8217;s
steers in the Bush.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bump or two don&#8217;t count for much. What you
want to do is to hump yourself and make things hum,&#8221;
said Nasmyth&#8217;s partner, when another couple jostled
them.</p>
<p>Nasmyth expressed his concurrence in a gasp, and
contrived to save her from another crash, but when the
dance was over, he felt limp, and was conscious that his
partner was by no means satisfied with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Still, I really think I did
what I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl regarded him half compassionately. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t very much, but I guess you played
yourself out building that blamed dam.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>BY COMBAT</h3>
</div>
<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s partner condescended, as she said, to
give him another show, but he escaped from that
dance with only a few abrasions, and, though he failed
to obtain another with Laura, he contrived to enjoy
himself. All his Bush friends were not primitive. Some
of them had once played their parts in much more brilliant
functions. They had cultivated tastes, and he had
learned to recognize the strong points of those who had
not. After all, kindly hearts count for much, and it
was not unnatural that, like other exiles who have
plodded up and down that rugged land, he should think
highly of the hard-handed men and patient women who
willingly offer a night&#8217;s shelter and a share of their dried
apples, salt pork, and grindstone bread to the penniless
wanderer.</p>
<p>What was more to the purpose, a number of the guests
at the dance had swung the axe by his side, and fought
the river with him when the valley was filled with the
roar of water.</p>
<p>They had done their work gallantly, when it seemed
out of the question that they would ever receive the
money he had promised them, from sheer pride in their
manhood, and to keep their word, and now they danced
as determinedly.</p>
<p>There are no cramping conventions and very few
shams&ndash;&ndash;and the shams in those forests, it must be confessed,
are as a rule imported ones. In fact, there was
that evening, among all those in the pulp-mill, only one
man who seemed to disassociate himself from the general
good-will. That man was Waynefleet. He wore his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
old velvet jacket as a cloak of superciliousness&ndash;&ndash;or, at
least, that was how it seemed to the Bush-ranchers, who
recognized and resented an effete pride in the squeak of
his very ancient lacquered shoes. It is possible that he
did not mean to make himself in any way offensive, and
merely desired to indicate that he was graciously willing
to patronize their bucolic festivities. There would
have been something almost pathetic in his carefully preserved
dignity had it not been so obtrusively out of
place; and when they stood watching him for a moment
or two, Gordon expressed Nasmyth&#8217;s thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;How a man of that kind ever came to be Laura
Waynefleet&#8217;s father is more than I can figure out!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a question that worries me every time I
look at him. Guess she owes everything to her mother;
and Mrs. Waynefleet must have been a mighty patient
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled, but Gordon went on reflectively:
&#8220;You folks show your sense when you dump your freaks
into this country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It never seems to strike
you that it&#8217;s a little rough on us. What&#8217;s the matter
with men like Waynefleet is that you can&#8217;t teach them
sense. I&#8217;d have told him what I thought of him once
or twice when I saw the girl doing his work up at the
ranch if I&#8217;d figured it would have made any impression.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect it would have been useless,&#8221; remarked
Nasmyth. &#8220;After all, I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s exactly
your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon watched Laura Waynefleet as she swung
through a waltz on the arm of a sinewy rancher, and
his eyes softened curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only on the girl&#8217;s account,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry for her. Stills the blamed old image isn&#8217;t actively
unkind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he saw the sudden contraction of Nasmyth&#8217;s
face, and turned toward him. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
want you to understand this thing. If it would be any
comfort to her, I&#8217;d let Miss Waynefleet wipe her boots
on me, and in one way that&#8217;s about all I&#8217;m fit for. I
know enough to realize that she&#8217;d never waste a moment
thinking of a man like me, even if I hadn&#8217;t in another
way done for myself already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; Nasmyth replied quietly, &#8220;some women can
forgive a good deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon&#8217;s face hardened, and he seemed to straighten
himself. &#8220;Well, there are men&ndash;&ndash;any way, in this country&ndash;&ndash;who
have too much grit in them to go crawling,
broken, to any woman&#8217;s feet, and to expect her to pick
them up and mend them. Now you have heard me, and
I guess you understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth merely made a little gesture of sympathy.
After all, he had the average Englishman&#8217;s reticence, and
the free speech of that country still jarred upon him now
and then. He knew what Gordon had meant to impress
on him, and he was touched by generosity of the
motive, but for all that he felt relieved when Gordon
abruptly moved away. He danced another dance, and
then sauntered towards the dynamo room, where the
manager had set up a keg or two of heady Ontario cider.
Several men were refreshing themselves there, but they
did not see him when he approached the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that&#8217;s out of tone about this show
is Waynefleet,&#8221; said one of them who had once worked
for the rancher. &#8220;What do we want that blamed old
dead-beat round here for, when he can&#8217;t speak to anyone
but the Crown land-agent and the mill manager?&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the others laughed, but Nasmyth saw venomous
hatred in the big axeman&#8217;s face. It was, however,
not his business, and Waynefleet was a man for whom
he had no great liking. He was about to turn away
when the chopper went on again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Waynefleet&#8217;s a blamed old thief, as everybody
knows,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Him being what he is, I guess you
couldn&#8217;t blame his daughter&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth, whom they had not noticed yet, could not
quite hear what followed; but when somebody flung a
sharp, incredulous question at the speaker, he stood fast
in the doorway, with one hand clenched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the man, with a suggestive grin, &#8220;what
I mean&#8217;s quite plain. Is there any other girl, round this
settlement who&#8217;d make up to that dam-builder as she&#8217;s
doing, and slip quietly into his shanty alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth never learned what grievance against Waynefleet
or his daughter had prompted this virulence, nor
did it appear to matter. There was just sufficient foundation
for the man&#8217;s insinuation to render it perilous
if it was once permitted to pass unchallenged, and
Nasmyth realized that any attempt to handle the affair
delicately was not likely to be successful. He was afterwards
greatly astonished that he could think clearly and
impose a certain command upon himself; but he understood
exactly what it was most advisable for him to do,
and he set about it with a curious cold quietness which
served his purpose well.</p>
<p>There was a gasp of astonishment from one of the
group as he stepped forward into the light and looked
with steady eyes at the man who had spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are a d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; liar.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was what the others had expected, and they rose and
stood back a little from the pair, watching expectantly;
for they recognized that the affair was serious, and,
though Nasmyth had their sympathy, an impartial attitude
was the correct one now. Jake was tall and lean
and muscular; but perhaps the dam-builder&#8217;s quietness
disconcerted him, or his bitterness had only extended to
the rancher.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Jake growled, &#8220;you light out of this. I
don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve anything against&ndash;&ndash;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth had his back to the door, and he did not
see the grizzled Mattawa, who was supposed to be one
of the strongest choppers about the settlement, standing
a little behind him, and watching him and Jake
attentively. Still, one of the others did, and made a
sign to Mattawa that any support he might feel disposed
to offer his employer would not be tolerated in the meanwhile.
Nasmyth, however, realized that there was only
one course open to him, and he drew back one hand as
he met the uneasy eyes of the man in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to back down on what you said?&#8221;
he asked, with incisive quietness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; word,&#8221; the other man assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;you must take the consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung forward on his left foot, and there was a
thud as his scarred knuckles landed heavily in the middle
of the detractor&#8217;s face. He struck with an unexpected
swiftness and all the force that was in him, for he
had learned that the rules of the trial by combat are by
no means so hard and fast in British Columbia as they
are in England. As a matter of fact, it is not very frequently
resorted to there; but when men do fight, their
one object is to disable their opponents as soon as possible
and by any means available.</p>
<p>Jake reeled backwards a pace or two, and the spectators
said afterwards there was no reason why Nasmyth
should have permitted him to recover himself, as he did.
Two axes which the carpenters had been using stood
against the wall, and Jake caught up the nearest of them.
He swung the gleaming blade high, while the blood
trickled from his cut lips and the swollen veins rose on
his forehead. This, however, was going further than
the others considered admissible, and there was a protesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
shout, while one sturdy fellow cautiously slid
along the wall to get in behind the man who had the axe.</p>
<p>Still, for a second or two, which might have proved
fatal to him, Nasmyth had only his own resources to depend
upon, and he did the one thing that was possible.
The Canadian axe-haft is long, and he sprang straight
in at the man. As he did so, the big blade came down,
and flashed by a hand&#8217;s breadth behind his shoulders.
He felt a burning pain on the outside of his thigh, but
that did not seem to matter, and he was clutching at his
opponent&#8217;s throat when he was bodily flung aside. Then,
as he fell against the log wall, he had a momentary
glimpse of Jake bent backwards in Mattawa&#8217;s arms.
There was a brief floundering scuffle as the two men
reeled towards the black opening in the wall, and after
that a splash in the darkness outside, and Mattawa
stepped back into the room alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; hog is in the flume,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That did not appear to trouble any of the others. The
sluice was not deep, and, though it was certainly running
hard, it was scarcely likely that a stalwart Bushman
would suffer greatly from being washed along it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it will cool him off,&#8221; said one of them. &#8220;If
it doesn&#8217;t, and he comes back to make a fuss, we&#8217;ll heave
him in again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they turned and looked at Nasmyth, who sat
down somewhat limply on a cider keg. The blood,
which was running down his leg, made a little pool at
his feet. Mattawa, who crossed over to him, asked for
a knife, and when a man produced one, he slit Nasmyth&#8217;s
trousers up to the hip. Then he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;one of you will slip out kind of
quiet and bring Mr. Gordon along. Two more of you
will stand in the door there and not let anybody in.&#8221;</p>
<p>They obeyed him, and Mattawa looked down at
Nasmyth again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I guess the thing&#8217;s not serious,&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nasmyth ruefully, &#8220;in one way, I think
it is. You see, store clothes are dear, and this is the
only pair of trousers I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little laugh from the others, and he
knew he had done wisely, when they clumsily expressed
their satisfaction at his escape. He had, at least, discredited
Jake, and it was evident that if the man made
any more assertions of a similar nature, which was very
unlikely, no one would listen to them.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, nobody else seemed to be aware
that anything unusual was going on. All had happened
in a minute or two, and the clanging of the fiddle and
the patter of the dancers&#8217; feet had drowned any sound
that rose from the dynamo-room. Nasmyth had not
long to wait before Gordon stepped in and quietly set
about his surgical work, after someone had dipped up
a little water from the sluice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;it&#8217;s quite a nice clean slice,
and I guess it&#8217;s not going to trouble you much, though
you won&#8217;t walk very far for a week or two. As soon as
we can get you to the dam, I&#8217;ll put a proper dressing on.&#8221;
Then he looked up sharply. &#8220;In the meanwhile, I
don&#8217;t quite see how you cut yourself like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Nasmyth, with
evident reluctance. &#8220;I suppose you will have to be
told.&#8221; He looked round at the others. &#8220;Boys, I particularly
don&#8217;t want this thing to go any further.&#8221;</p>
<p>He related what had happened, and one of the men stood
up. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry over that,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not going to talk, and if Jake does, one of us will pound
a little sense into him. Now I&#8217;ll slip out and get Highton&#8217;s
team.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that they gave Nasmyth some cider, and a few
minutes later he limped out through the opening in the
wall and across the plank they laid above the sluice to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
the waiting waggon. It was not far to the dam, and before
very long Gordon was back again at the mill. It
naturally happened, though he was anxious to avoid
her, that Laura Waynefleet was the first person who accosted
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Mr. Nasmyth?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Gordon. &#8220;I saw him a little while
ago. You are wanting him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura laughed. &#8220;I believed I promised him another
dance. It&#8217;s a little curious he hasn&#8217;t come for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In one way it&#8217;s deplorably bad taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was quick to notice that his gaze was not
quite frank, and he winced when for a moment she
laid her hand upon his arm, for he saw the veiled anxiety
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has been going on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t want to tell me where Mr. Nasmyth is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has just gone back to the dam. He got hurt&ndash;&ndash;a
trifling cut&ndash;&ndash;nothing more than that. Still, I insisted
on tying it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; cried Laura sharply, &#8220;you evidently don&#8217;t wish
me to know how he got it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just what I don&#8217;t mean to do. Any way, it&#8217;s
not worth while troubling about. Nasmyth&#8217;s injury
isn&#8217;t in the least serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to strike you that I could ask him
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon would have liked to warn her to keep away
from the dam, but he did not see how it could be done
unless he offered some reason, and that was a thing he
shrank from.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you certainly could.&#8221; Then he
glanced down at her hands. &#8220;Those are unusually
pretty gloves you have on.&#8221;</p>
<p>His answer was, as it happened, almost as injudicious
as he could have rendered it, since it left the girl determined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
to sift the matter thoroughly. She, however, only
smiled just then.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there isn&#8217;t a nicer pair of gloves in Canada
than these,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Gordon took himself away, wondering what she could
have meant by that; and Laura waited until next day,
when, although there was, as usual, a good deal to be
done about the ranch, she went down to find out what
was the matter with Nasmyth.</p>
<p>The injured man was sitting in his shanty, with his
foot upon a chair, but he rose when she came in, and
stood leaning rather hard upon the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very kind of you to come,&#8221; he said, taking her
hand. He made shift to limp to the door, whence he
called for Mattawa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring those two chairs out, Tom, and put them in
the sun,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The old axeman shook his head severely. &#8220;You sit
right down again. What in the name of wonder are
you on your legs for, any way?&#8221; he asked. Then he saw
Laura, and made a little gesture of resignation. &#8220;Well,
I guess it will have to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sudden change in his attitude was naturally not
lost upon the girl, but she kept her astonishment to herself,
and waited until Mattawa had made Nasmyth as
comfortable as possible. Then she turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry you are hurt,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I understand
it was an axe cut. How did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth appeared to reflect. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;I suppose I was a little careless&ndash;&ndash;in fact, I must have
been. You see, some of the building gang had left their
axes in the dynamo-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Laura dryly, &#8220;certainly accounts for
the axe being there. I&#8217;m not sure it goes very much
further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It really wasn&#8217;t very much of a cut.&#8221; Nasmyth&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
desire to escape from the topic was a trifle too plain, as
he added, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it nice out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>It occurred to Laura that it was uncomfortably cold,
for there was a nip of frost in the air, though the sun
hung coppery red above the sombre pines.</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost fancied you were not overjoyed to see me,&#8221;
she remarked.</p>
<p>Nasmyth appeared momentarily embarrassed, but his
expression suddenly changed, and Laura felt a faint thrill
when he laid his hand upon her arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is a fancy you must never entertain
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one respect Laura was fully satisfied, and, though
there was still a great deal upon which she meant to be
enlightened, she talked about other matters for almost
half an hour, and then rose with a little shiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must get back to the settlement, where I have left
the team,&#8221; she said, and glanced down at him for a
moment with solicitude in her eyes. &#8220;You will be very
careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth let her go, but he did not know that she
signed to Mattawa, who was then busy hewing out a
big redwood log. The axeman strolled after her into
the Bush, and then stopped to look hard at her as he
uttered an inquiring, &#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;can&#8217;t you understand that it
would be very much wiser if somebody told me exactly
how Mr. Nasmyth got hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>The axeman nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he admitted, with a
wink, &#8220;that&#8217;s just how it strikes me, and I&#8217;m going to.
The boss has no more arms and legs than he&#8217;s a use for
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura gazed at him in bewilderment, but the man&#8217;s
expression was perfectly grave. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I
guess one can talk straight sense to you, and the fact is
I can&#8217;t have you coming round here again. Just listen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
about two minutes, and I&#8217;ll try to make the thing clear
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did so with a certain graphic force that she had
not expected from him, and the colour crept into her
cheeks. Then, to Mattawa&#8217;s astonishment, she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said simply. &#8220;But the other man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Mattawa, &#8220;if he goes round talking,
somebody will &#8217;most pound the life out of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he swung round abruptly, for he was shrewd,
and had his primitive notions of delicacy; and Laura
went on through the stillness of the Bush, with a curious
softness in her eyes. Mattawa had been terse, and, in
some respects, his observations had not been tactful, but
nobody could have impressed her more in Nasmyth&#8217;s
favour. Indeed, at the moment, she scarcely remembered
how the aspersions Jake had made might affect
herself. As it happened, she met Gordon near the settlement,
and he stopped a moment. He had come upon
her suddenly, and had looked at her with a suggestive
steadiness, but she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have been to the dam. After
the way in which you made it evident that you didn&#8217;t
want me to go there, it was, perhaps, no more than
you could have expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; rejoined Gordon, with a look of anxiety,
&#8220;you probably got hold of Mattawa. Well, after all,
I guess he has done the wise thing.&#8221; Then after a pause
he observed, &#8220;There is very little the matter with your
courage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy,&#8221; observed Laura half wistfully, &#8220;that is, in
several respects, fortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she went on again, and though Gordon felt exceedingly
compassionate, he frowned and closed one
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sure thing I&#8217;ll have to tell Waynefleet what
kind of a man he is,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>GORDON SPEAKS HIS MIND</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a nipping morning, and the clearing outside
the ranch was flecked with patches of frozen snow,
when Waynefleet sat shivering in a hide chair beside the
stove. The broken viands upon the table in front of
him suggested that he had just made a tolerable breakfast,
but his pose was expressive of limp resignation, and
one could have fancied from the look in his thin face that
he was feeling very sorry for himself. Self-pity, in fact,
was rather a habit of his, and, perhaps, because of it, he
had usually very little pity to spare for anybody else. He
looked up when, flushed and gasping, his daughter came
in with two heavy pails of water. She shivered visibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a favour if you would shut that door
as soon as you can,&#8221; said Waynefleet. &#8220;As I fancy I have
mentioned, this cold goes right through me. It occurred
to me that you might have come in a little earlier to see
if I was getting my breakfast properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura, who glanced at the table, thought that he had
acquitted himself reasonably well, but she refrained
from pointing out the fact, and, after shutting the door,
crossed the room to her store-cupboard, and took out a
can of fruit which she had set aside for another purpose.
Waynefleet watched her open it and made a little sign of
impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very clumsy this morning,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s hands were wet and stiff with cold, but she
quietly laid another plate upon the table before she answered
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charly is busy in the slashing, and I don&#8217;t want to
take him away, but there are those logs in the wet patch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
that ought to be hauled out now the ground is hard,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I suppose you don&#8217;t feel equal to doing it
to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Waynefleet with querulous incisiveness,
&#8220;it is quite out of the question. Do I look like a man
who could reasonably be expected to undertake anything
of that kind just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>It occurred to Laura that he did not look as if there
was very much the matter with him, and she stood still
a minute considering. As Gordon had said, it was she
who managed the ranch, and she recognized that it was
desirable that the trees in question should be dragged out
of the soft ground while the frost lasted. Still, there
was the baking and washing, and it would be late at
night before she could accomplish half she wished to
do, if she undertook the task in question. While she
thought over it her father spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would sit down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel I
must have quietness, and your restless habits jar upon me
horribly.&#8221;</p>
<p>That decided her, and slipping into her own room, she
put on an old blanket coat, and went out quietly. She
walked through the orchard to the little log stable where
the working oxen stood, and, after patting the patient
beasts, shackled a heavy chain to the yoke she laid upon
their brawny necks. Then, picking up a handspike, she
led them out, and for an hour walked beside them,
tapping them with a long pointed stick, while they
dragged the big logs out of the swamp. Now and then
it taxed all her strength to lift the thinner end of a
log on the chain-sling with a handspike, but she contrived
to do it until at length one heavier than the
others proved too much for her. She could hear the
ringing of the hired man&#8217;s axe across the clearing, but
there was a great deal for him to do, and, taking up the
handspike again, she strained at it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>She heard footsteps behind her, and she straightened
herself suddenly. She turned and saw Gordon watching
her with a curious smile. Tall and straight and
supple, with a ruddy, half-guilty glow on her face, she
stood near the middle of the little gap in the Bush, the
big dappled oxen close at her side. The wintry sunlight,
which struck upon her, tinted the old blanket dress
a shining ochre, and the loose tress of red-gold hair, which
had escaped from beneath her little fur cap, struck a
dominant tone of glowing colour among the pale reds
and russets of the fir-trunks and withered fern.</p>
<p>Gordon shook his head reproachfully. &#8220;Sit down a
minute or two, and I&#8217;ll heave that log on to the sling,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;This is not the kind of thing you ought to be
doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura, who was glad of the excuse, sat down on one
of the logs, while the man leaned against a fir and
gravely regarded her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The work must be done by somebody, and my
father is apparently not very well again,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;Charly has his hands full in the slashing. We must
get it cleaned up, if it is to be ploughed this spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nasmyth contrived to look after all these things.
Why didn&#8217;t you keep him? The man didn&#8217;t want to go
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The colour deepened in Laura&#8217;s face, and Gordon,
who saw it, made a sign of comprehension. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;I suppose that wasn&#8217;t a thing one could expect
you to tell me, though I don&#8217;t quite see why you
shouldn&#8217;t think of yourself now and then. You know
it wasn&#8217;t on your own account you sent him away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does this concern you?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Gordon flung one hand out. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how
does it concern me?&#8221; Then he seemed to lay a restraint
upon himself. &#8220;Well, it does in one sense, anyway.
After all, I am a doctor, and a friend of yours, and I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
going to warn you against attempting things women
weren&#8217;t meant to do. If that doesn&#8217;t prove efficacious,
I&#8217;ll say a word or two to Nasmyth, and you&#8217;ll have him
back here again. It&#8217;s a sure thing your father would be
glad to get him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do, I shall never forgive you,&#8221; warned Laura,
with a flash in her eyes.</p>
<p>She was sorry she had spoken so plainly when she
saw that Gordon winced. She had guessed more or less
correctly what the man felt for her, and she had no wish
to pain him. Except for that, however, the admission
she had made did not greatly matter, since she fancied
that he was quite aware why she had sent Nasmyth
away. Gordon changed the subject abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are very few of those blanket dresses this side
of the Rockies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You probably got it back
East.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes had a wistful look as she answered:
&#8220;We spent our first winter in Montreal, and we had
some friends who were very kind to us. I like to look
back upon those first few months in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon nodded. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I know&ndash;&ndash;sleigh-rides,
snowshoe meets, skating-rinks, toboggan-slides.
Quite as lively as a London season, and considerably
more invigorating; I guess you&#8217;ve been through
that, too. In one way it&#8217;s a pity you didn&#8217;t stay in Montreal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw her sudden embarrassment, and fancied that
she could have stayed there, if she had wished to do so,
but he felt that he must speak frankly, and he shook his
head severely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you never think of your own advantage at all?&#8221;
he inquired. &#8220;Have you none of the ambitions that most
women seem to have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you forgetting?&#8221; Laura asked with sudden
quietness. &#8220;My father found it would not be advisable
for him to settle in Montreal&ndash;&ndash;for the same reason that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
afterwards led us to leave Victoria&ndash;&ndash;and we went West.
Perhaps he could have faced the trouble and lived it
down, but I could not leave him alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon sat silent a moment or two. He knew, though
she very rarely mentioned it, how heavy was the burden
that had been laid upon her, and he was divided between
a great pity for her and anger against her father. Then
he rose slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Waynefleet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I have said anything
that hurt you, I&#8217;m sorry, but there are times when I
must talk. I feel I have to. In the meanwhile I&#8217;ll
heave those logs up on a skid so that you can slip the
chain round them.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the next half-hour he exerted himself savagely,
and when at last he dropped the handspike, his face was
damp with perspiration. He smiled grimly when Laura,
who had hauled one or two of the logs away, came back
tapping the plodding oxen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going in to see your father.
Custer happened to tell me he was feeling low again,
and it&#8217;s going to afford me a good deal of pleasure to
prescribe for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung off his wide hat, and, when he turned away,
Laura wondered with a few misgivings what had brought
the little snap into his eyes. Three or four minutes
later he entered the house, where Waynefleet lay beside
the stove with a cigar in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran across Custer at the settlement, and I came
along to see how you were keeping,&#8221; said Gordon.</p>
<p>Waynefleet held out a cigar-box. &#8220;Make yourself
comfortable,&#8221; he answered hospitably. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have dinner
a little earlier than usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sight of the label on the box came near rousing
Gordon to an outbreak of indignation. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going
to stay,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;It seems to me Miss Waynefleet
has about enough to do already.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw Waynefleet raise his eyebrows, and he added:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s not worth while troubling to point out
that it&#8217;s not my affair. Now, if you&#8217;ll get ahead with
your symptoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet looked hard at him for a moment. The
older man was not accustomed to being addressed in that
brusque fashion, and it jarred upon him, but, as a matter
of fact, he was not feeling well, and, as he not infrequently
pointed out, he had discovered that one had to
put up with many unpleasant things in that barbarous
country. He described his symptoms feelingly, and was
rather indignant when Gordon expressed neither astonishment
nor sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Gordon. &#8220;The thing&#8217;s quite
plain&ndash;&ndash;especially the general lassitude you complain of.
The trouble is that if you don&#8217;t make an effort it&#8217;s
going to become chronic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Waynefleet looked at him in astonishment, for
Gordon&#8217;s tone was very suggestive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added the medical adviser, &#8220;it&#8217;s a complaint a
good many men, who haven&#8217;t been raised to work, are
afflicted with. Well, I&#8217;ll mix you up a tonic, and you&#8217;ll
drive down for it yourself. The thing won&#8217;t be half as
efficacious if you send the hired man. Then you&#8217;ll set
to every morning soon as breakfast&#8217;s over, and do a
couple of hours&#8217; smart chopping for a week. By that
time you&#8217;ll find it easy, and you can go on an hour or
two in the afternoon. Nobody round here will recognize
you, if you keep it up for the next three months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet&#8217;s thin face grew red, but Gordon&#8217;s imperturbable
demeanour restrained him from betraying his
indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand that I couldn&#8217;t swing an axe
for five minutes together,&#8221; he objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble,&#8221; answered Gordon, &#8220;is that you don&#8217;t
want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet made an attempt to rise, but his companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
laid a hand upon his arm and pressed him down
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were anxious for my advice, and now I&#8217;m going
to prescribe,&#8221; Gordon continued. &#8220;Two hours&#8217; steady
chopping every day, to be raised by degrees to six. Then
I&#8217;d let up on smoking cigars of that kind, and practise
a little more self-denial in one or two other respects.
You could make things easier for Miss Waynefleet with
the money you save.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose with a laugh. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going. All you
have to do is to carry out my suggestions, and you may
still make yourself and your ranch a credit to the district.
In the meanwhile, this place would be considerably
improved by a little ventilation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went out, and left Waynefleet gazing in indignant
astonishment at the door he carefully fixed
open. It seemed to Waynefleet almost incredible that
such words should have been spoken to him, and the
suggestion that at the cost of a painful effort he should endeavour
to make himself a credit to that barbarous neighbourhood
rankled most of all. He had felt, hitherto, that
he had conferred a favour on the community by settling
there. He lay still until his daughter came in and glanced
at him inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen Mr. Gordon?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; answered Waynefleet with fine disdain.
&#8220;You will understand that if he comes back here, he
must be kept away from me. The man is utterly devoid
of refinement or consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Gordon was riding, circumspectly,
down the rutted trail, and it was an hour later when
he dismounted at the shanty of Nasmyth&#8217;s workmen, and
shared a meal with the gang employed on the dam. After
that he sat with Nasmyth, who still limped a little, in
the hut, from which, as the door stood open, they could
see the men stream up into the Bush and out along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
dam. The dam now stood high above the water-level,
for the frost had bound fast the feeding snow upon the
peaks above, though the stream roared and frothed
through the two big sluice-gates. By-and-by, the ringing
of axes and the clink of drills broke through the
sound of the rushing waters. Gordon, who stretched
himself out on a deer-hide lounge, smiled at Nasmyth
as he lighted his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been talking a little sense to Waynefleet this
morning. I felt I had to, though I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s not
going to be any use,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you were warranted or not is, of course,
another matter,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;Perhaps you were,
if you did it on Miss Waynefleet&#8217;s account. Anyway,
I don&#8217;t altogether understand why you should be sure
it will have no effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon looked at him with a grin. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he remarked
oracularly, &#8220;it&#8217;s easy to acquire an inflated notion
of one&#8217;s own importance, though it&#8217;s quite often a little
difficult to keep it. Something&#8217;s very apt to come along and
prick you, and you collapse flat when it lets the inflation
out. In some cases one never quite gets one&#8217;s self-sufficiency
back. The scar the prick made is always there,
but it&#8217;s different with Waynefleet. He is made of self-closing
jelly, and when you take the knife out the gap
shuts up again. It&#8217;s quite hard to fancy it was ever
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded gravely, for there was an elusive
something in his comrade&#8217;s tone that roused his sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is it quite impossible for you to
go back East again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon leaned back in his chair, and glanced out
across the toiling men upon the dam, at the frothing
river and rugged hillside, with a look of longing in his
eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In one way it is, but I want you to understand,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;I might begin again in some desolate little
town&ndash;&ndash;but I aimed higher&ndash;&ndash;and was once very nearly
getting there. As it is, if I made my mark, the thing I
did would be remembered against me. We&#8217;ll let it go.
As a surgeon of any account I&#8217;m done for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, it&#8217;s a tolerably big country, and folks forget.
You might, at least, go so far, and that would, after
all, give you a good deal&ndash;&ndash;a competence, the right to
marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon laughed, but his voice was harsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the days on which I must talk. I
feel like that, now and then,&#8221; he said. Then he looked
at Nasmyth hard. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve seen the one woman I
could marry, and it&#8217;s certain that, if I dare make her
the offer, she would never marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;you seem quite sure of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; declared Gordon, and there was, for a moment
or two, an almost uncomfortable silence in the
shanty.</p>
<p>Then he made a little forceful gesture as he turned to
his companion again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;after all, what does it count for?
Is it man&#8217;s one and only business to marry somebody?
Of course, we have folks back East, who seem to act
on that belief, and in your country half of them appear
to spend their time and energies philandering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s half,&#8221; said Nasmyth dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a point of any importance, and we&#8217;ll let it
go. Anyway, it seems perilously easy for a man who
gets the woman he sets his mind upon to sink into a
fireside hog in the civilized world. Now and then, when
things go wrong with folks of that kind, they come out
here, and nobody has any use for them. What can you
do with the man who gets sick the first time he sleeps
in the rain, and can&#8217;t do without his dinner? Oh, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
know all about the preservation of the species, but
west of the Great Lakes we&#8217;ve no room for any species
that isn&#8217;t tough and fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment. &#8220;After all, this is the
single man&#8217;s country, and&ndash;&ndash;we&ndash;&ndash;know that it demands
from him the best that he was given, from the grimmest
toil of his body to the keenest effort of his brain. Marriage
is a detail&ndash;&ndash;an incident; we&#8217;re here to fight, to
grapple with the wilderness, and to break it in, and that
burden wasn&#8217;t laid upon us only for the good of ourselves.
When we&#8217;ve flung our trestles over the rivers,
and blown room for the steel track out of the ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s
side, the oat-fields and the orchards creep up the valleys,
and the men from the cities set up their mills. Prospector,
track-layer, chopper, follow in sequence here, and
then we&#8217;re ready to hold out our hands to the thousands
you&#8217;ve no use or food for back yonder. I&#8217;m not sure it
matters that the men who do the work don&#8217;t often share
the results of it. We bury them beside our bridge trestles
and under tons of shattered rock, and, perhaps, when
their time comes, some of them aren&#8217;t sorry to have done
with it. Anyway, they&#8217;ve stood up to man&#8217;s primeval
task.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose with another half-deprecatory laugh, but his
eyes snapped. &#8220;You don&#8217;t talk like that in your country&ndash;&ndash;it
would hurt some of you&ndash;&ndash;but if we spread ourselves
now and then, you can look round and see the
things we do.&#8221; Then he touched Nasmyth&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;Oh, yes, you understand&ndash;&ndash;for somebody has taught
you&ndash;&ndash;and by-and-by, you&#8217;re going to feel the thing getting
hold of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved towards the doorway, but turned as he
reached it. &#8220;Talking&#8217;s cheap, and I have several dozen
blamed big firs to saw up, as well as Waynefleet&#8217;s tonic
to mix. He&#8217;ll come along for it when that prick I gave
him commences to heal.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE CALLING CA&Ntilde;ON</h3>
</div>
<p>There were four wet and weary men in the Siwash
canoe that Nasmyth, who crouched astern, had just
shot across the whirling pool with the back feathering
stroke of his paddle which is so difficult to acquire. Tom
from Mattawa, grasping a dripping pole, stood up in
the bow. Gordon and Wheeler, the pulp-mill manager,
knelt in the middle of the boat. Wheeler&#8217;s hands were
blistered from gripping the paddle-haft, and his knees
were raw, where he had pressed them against the bottom
of the craft to obtain a purchase. It was several years
since he had undertaken any severe manual labour,
though he was by no means unused to it, and he was
cramped and aching in every limb. He had plied pole
or paddle for eight hours, during which his companions
had painfully propelled the craft a few miles into the
ca&ntilde;on. He gasped with relief when Mattawa ran the
bow of the canoe in upon the shingle, and then rose
and stretched himself wearily. The four men stepped
ashore. Curiously they looked about them, for they
had had little opportunity for observation. Those who
undertake to pole a canoe up the rapids of a river on the
Pacific slope usually find it advisable to confine their
attention strictly to the business in hand.</p>
<p>Immediately in front of them the river roared and
seethed amid giant boulders, which rose out of a tumultuous
rush of foam, but while it was clearly beyond the
power of flesh and blood to drive the canoe up against
the current, a strip of shingle, also strewn with boulders
and broken by ledges of dripping rock, divided the water
from the wall of the ca&ntilde;on. The ca&ntilde;on, a tremendous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
slope of rock with its dark crest overhanging them, ran
up high above their heads; but they could see the pines
clinging to the hillside which rose from the edge of the
other wall across the river, so steep that it appeared impossible
to find a foothold upon it.</p>
<p>The four men were down in the bottom of a great rift
in the hills, and, though it would be day above for at
least two hours, the light was faint in the hollow and
dimmed by drifting mist. It was a spot from which
a man new to that wild country might well have shrunk,
and the roar of water rang through it in tremendous,
nerve-taxing pulsations. Nasmyth and his companions,
however, had gone there with no particular purpose&ndash;&ndash;merely
for relaxation&ndash;&ndash;though it had cost them hours
of arduous labour, and the journey had been a more or
less hazardous one. Wheeler, the pulp-mill manager,
was waiting for his machinery, and, Nasmyth had finished
the dam. When they planned the journey for pleasure,
Mattawa and Gordon had gone with them ostensibly
on a shooting trip. There are game laws, which set
forth when and where a man may shoot, and how many
heads he is entitled to, but it must be admitted that the
Bush-rancher seldom concerns himself greatly about them.
When he fancies a change of diet, he goes out and kills
a deer. Still, though all the party had rifles no one
would have cared very much if they had not come across
anything to shoot at.</p>
<p>Now and then a vague unrest comes upon the Bushman,
and he sets off for the wilderness, and stays there
while his provisions hold out. He usually calls it prospecting,
but as a rule he comes back with his garments
rent to tatters, and no record of any mineral claim or
timber rights, but once more contentedly he goes on with
his task. It may be a reawakening of forgotten instincts,
half-conscious lust of adventure, or a mere desire for
change, that impels him to make the journey, but it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
at least an impulse with which most men who toil in
those forests are well acquainted.</p>
<p>Nasmyth and Mattawa pulled the canoe out, and
when they sat down and lighted their pipes, Wheeler
grinned as he drew up his duck trousers and surveyed
his knees, which were raw and bleeding. Then he held
up one of his hands that his comrades might notice the
blisters upon it. He was a little, wiry man with dark
eyes, which had a snap in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;we&#8217;re here, and I guess any
man with sense enough to prefer whole bones to broken
ones would wonder why we are. It&#8217;s most twelve years
since I used to head off into the Bush this way in Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon glanced at him with a twinkle in his eyes.
&#8220;Now,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;you&#8217;ve hit the reason the first
time. When you&#8217;ve done it once, you&#8217;ll do it again.
You have to. Perhaps it&#8217;s Nature&#8217;s protest against your
axiom that man&#8217;s chief business is dollar-making. Still,
I&#8217;m admitting that this is a blamed curious place for
Nasmyth to figure on killing a wapiti in. Say, are you
going to sleep here to-night, Derrick?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was very evident that none of the big wapiti&ndash;&ndash;elks,
as the Bushman incorrectly calls them&ndash;&ndash;could have
reached that spot, but Nasmyth laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt I&#8217;d like to see the fall&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know why,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s scarcely another mile, and I&#8217;ve been up
almost that far with an Indian before. There&#8217;s a ravine
with young spruce in it where we could sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; announced Wheeler resolutely, &#8220;we&#8217;re starting
right now. When I pole a canoe up a place of this
kind I want to see where I&#8217;m going. I once went down
a big rapid with the canoe-bottom up in front of me
in the dark, and one journey of that kind is quite enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>They dumped out their camp gear, and took hold of
the canoe, a beautifully modelled, fragile thing, hollowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
out of a cedar log, and for the next half-hour hauled it
laboriously over some sixty yards of boulders and pushed
it, walking waist-deep, across rock-strewn pools. Then
they went back for their wet tent, axes, rifles, blankets,
and a bag of flour, and when they had reloaded the canoe,
they took up the poles again. It was the hardest kind
of work, and demanded strength and skill, for a very
small blunder would have meant wreck upon some froth-lapped
boulder, or an upset into the fierce white rush of
the river, but at length they reached a deep whirling
pool, round which long smears of white froth swung in
wild gyrations. The smooth rock rose out of the pool
without even a cranny one could slip a hand into, and
the river fell tumultuously over a ledge into the head
of it. The water swept out of a veil of thin white mist,
and the great rift rang with a bewildering din. One
felt that the vast primeval forces were omnipotent there.
As the men looked about them with the spray on their
wet faces and the white mist streaming by, Mattawa, who
stood up forward, dropped suddenly into the bottom of
the canoe.</p>
<p>&#8220;In poles,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Paddle! Get a move on her!&#8221;
Nasmyth, who felt his pole dip into empty water,
flung it in and grabbed his paddle, for the craft shot
forward suddenly with the swing of the eddy towards
the fall. He did not know whether the stream would
sweep them under it, but he was not desirous of affording
it the opportunity. For perhaps a minute they exerted
themselves furiously, gasping as they strained aching
arms and backs, and meanwhile, in spite of them, beneath
the towering fall of rock, the canoe slid on toward
the fall. It also drew a little nearer to the middle of
the pool, where there was a curious bevelled hollow,
round which the white foam spun. It seemed to Nasmyth
that the stream went bodily down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paddle,&#8221; said Mattawa hoarsely. &#8220;Heave her clear
of it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>They drove furiously between the white-streaked shoot
of the fall and that horribly suggestive whirling; then,
as they went back towards the outrush from the pool,
they made another desperate, gasping effort. For several
moments it seemed that they must be swept back again,
and then they gained a little, and, with a few more
strokes, reached the edge of the rapid. They let the
canoe drive down the rapid while the boulders flashed
by them, for there was the same desire in all of them,
and that was to get as far as possible away from that
horrible pool. At last Mattawa, standing up forward,
poled the canoe in where a deep ravine rent the dark
rock&#8217;s side, and the party went ashore, wet and gasping.
Wheeler looked back up the gorge and solemnly shook
his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to see any more of it, you&#8217;ve got to
do it alone. I&#8217;ve had enough,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;A man
who runs a pulp-mill has no use for paddling under that
kind of fall. I&#8217;m not going back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa and Gordon set the tent up in the hollow
of the ravine, while Wheeler hewed off spruce branches
with which to make the beds; but Nasmyth did nothing
to assist any of them. Thinking hard, he sat on a boulder,
with his unlighted pipe in his hand. The throbbing
roar of water rang about him; and it was then that the
great project crept into his mind. It was rapidly growing
dark in the bottom of the great rift, but he could still
see the dim white flashing of the fall and the vast wall
of rock and rugged hillside that ran up in shadowy
grandeur, high above his head, and as he gazed at it
all he felt his heart throb fast. He was conscious
of a curious thrill as he watched and listened
to that clash of stupendous forces. The river had
spent countless ages cutting out that channel, hurling
down mighty boulders and stream-driven shingle upon
the living rock; but it was, it seemed to him, within
man&#8217;s power to alter it in a few arduous months. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
sat very still, astonished at the daring of his own conception,
until Wheeler strolled up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much does the river drop at the fall?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;About eight feet in the fall itself,&#8221; answered
Wheeler. &#8220;Seems to me it falls much more in the
rush above. Still, I can&#8217;t say I noticed it particularly&ndash;&ndash;I
had something else to think about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a short rapid,&#8221; remarked Nasmyth reflectively.
&#8220;There is, no doubt, a great deal of the hardest kind of
rock under it, which is, in one or two respects, unfortunate.
I suppose you don&#8217;t know very much about
geology?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; confessed the pulp-miller. &#8220;Machines are
my specialty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t either,
and I believe one or two of these ca&ntilde;ons have puzzled
wiser folks than I. You see, the general notion is that
the rivers made them, but it doesn&#8217;t seem quite reasonable
to imagine a river tilting at a solid range and splitting
it through the middle. In fact, it seems to me that some
of the ca&ntilde;ons were there already, and the rivers just
ran into them. One or two Indians have come down
from the valley close to the fall, and they told me the
river was quite deep there. The rock just holds it up
at the fall. It&#8217;s a natural dam&ndash;&ndash;a dyke, I think they
call it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand what all this is leading to,&#8221;
observed Wheeler.</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed, though there was, as his companion
noticed, a curious look in his eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to make it
clearer when we get into the valley. We&#8217;re going there
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was almost dark now, and they went back together
to the little fire that burned redly among the spruces
in the ravine. There Mattawa and Gordon had a simple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
supper ready. The others stretched themselves out, rolled
in their blankets, soon after they had eaten, but
Nasmyth lay propped up on one elbow, wide awake,
listening to the roar of water until well into the night.
The stream drowned the faint rustling of the spruces
in a great dominant note, and he set his lips as he recognized
its depth of tone and volume. He had once more determined
to pit all his strength of mind and body against
the river. Still, he went to sleep at last, and awakening
some time after it was dawn on the heights above,
roused his comrades. When breakfast was over he
started with them up the ravine to cross the range.</p>
<p>It was afternoon before they accomplished the climb,
though the height was not great and a ravine pierced the
crest, and they had rent most of their clothes to tatters
when they scrambled down the slope into the valley.
Those pine-shrouded hillsides are strewn with mighty
fallen trees, amid which the tangled underbrush grows
tall and rank, and, where the pines are less thickly
spaced, there are usually matted groves of willows, if
the soil is damp. They pitched camp on the edge of the
valley, and Gordon and Nasmyth prepared supper, while
Wheeler cut firewood and Mattawa went out to prospect
for the tracks of feeding deer. The axeman came back
to say there were no signs of any wapiti, though the
little Bush deer were evidently about, and it was decided
to try for one that night with the pitlight, a mode of
shooting now and then adopted when the deer are shy.</p>
<p>They ate their supper, and afterwards lay down with
their blankets rolled about them, for it grew very cold
as darkness crept up the valley. Like most of the other
valleys, this one was walled in by steep-sided, pine-shrouded
hills; but in this case there were no trees in
the bottom of it, which, while very narrow, appeared
several miles long. It was also nearly level, and the
river wound through it in deep, still bends. There are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
not many valleys in that country in which heavy timber
fails to grow, and those within reach of a market have
been seized upon; for all ranch produce is in excellent
demand, and the clearing of virgin forest is a singularly
arduous task. In fact, there was only one reason why
this strip of natural prairie had not already been claimed.
Most of it was swamp. Nasmyth, who was quieter than
usual, watched the filmy mist creep about it as the soft
darkness rolled down the hillsides.</p>
<p>Gordon rose and hooked a pitlight into his hat. This
pitlight consists simply of a little open miner&#8217;s-lamp,
which has fixed beneath it a shield cut out of any convenient
meat-can. The lamp is filled with seal oil. Once
a man has fastened it upon his head, the light is cut off
from his person, so that he stands invisible, and the little
flame appears unsupported. Deer of any kind are endued
with an inquisitiveness which frequently leads to
their destruction, and when they notice the twinkling
light flitting through the air they approach it to ascertain
the reason for such an unusual thing. Then the
rancher shoots, as soon as their shining eyes become visible.</p>
<p>The party divided. Gordon and Nasmyth, who kept
near each other, fell over several rotting trees, and into
what appeared to be crumbling drains. They floundered
knee-deep through withered timothy, which is not a natural
grass. For an hour or two nobody saw any deer.
Then Gordon, who was cautiously skirting another drain,
closed in on Nasmyth until he touched his comrade.
Nasmyth heard a crackling rustle among the withered
grass. Gordon made a little abrupt movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we both blaze off, we double the odds on our
getting it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth only just heard him, for his heart was beating
with excitement; but as he stood knee-deep in the
grass, with both hands ready to pitch the heavy rifle up,
it seemed to him that Mattawa could not have been correct
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
when he said that there were only the Bush deer
about. Judging by the noise it was making, the approaching
beast, he thought, must be as big as a wapiti. Then
he saw two pale spots of light, which seemed curiously
high above the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m shooting,&#8221; he said, and in another moment the
butt was into his shoulder.</p>
<p>He felt the jar of it, but, as usual in such cases, he
heard no detonation, though the pale flash from Gordon&#8217;s
rifle was almost in his eyes. He, however, heard the
thud of the heavy bullet, and a moment or two later,
a floundering amidst the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;That can&#8217;t be a Bush deer!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds &#8217;way more like an elephant,&#8221; said Gordon,
with a gasp.</p>
<p>They ran forward until they stopped a few yards
short of something very big and shadowy that was still
struggling in the grass. Gordon cautiously crept up a
little nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those aren&#8217;t deer&#8217;s horns, anyway,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Plug it quick. The blamed thing&#8217;s getting up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth flung the rifle up to his shoulder, and twice
jerked a fresh cartridge into the chamber, but this time
there was silence when the crash of the heavy Marlin
died away among the woods. They crept forward a
little further circumspectly, until Gordon stopped again
with a gasp of consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I guess it couldn&#8217;t be either a
Bush deer or a wapiti.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were still standing there when their comrades
came running up, and Mattawa, who took down his
light, broke into a great hoarse laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;A steer!&#8221; he said, and pointed to a mark on the
hide. &#8220;One of Custer&#8217;s stock. Guess he&#8217;ll charge you
quite a few dollars for killing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled somewhat ruefully, for he was by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
no means burdened with wealth, but he was, after all,
not greatly astonished. Few of the small ranchers can
feed their stock entirely on their little patches of cleared
land, and it is not an unusual thing for most of the herd
to run almost wild in the Bush. Now and then, the
cattle acquire a somewhat perilous fondness for wrecking
road-makers&#8217; and prospectors&#8217; tents, which explains
why a steer occasionally fails to be found and some little
community of axemen is provided with more fresh meat
than can well be consumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s rather more than likely I&#8217;ll have to
pay a good price,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;Do you feel anxious
for any more shooting to-night, Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the pulp-miller, with a grin, as he surveyed
his bemired clothes. &#8220;Guess it&#8217;s going to prove expensive,
and I&#8217;ve had &#8217;most enough. I don&#8217;t feel like
poling that canoe any farther up-river, either. What&#8217;s
the matter with camping right where we are until we
eat the steer?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was, however, as Mattawa pointed out, a good
deal to be done before they could make their first meal
off the beast, and none of them quite relished the task,
especially as they had only an axe and a couple of moderately
long knives. Still, it was done, and when they
carried a portion of the meat out of the swamp, and
had gone down to wash in the icy river, they went wearily
back to their tent among the firs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT IDEA</h3>
</div>
<p>The night was cold, and a frost-laden wind set the
fir branches sighing as Nasmyth and his comrades
sat about a snapping fire. The red light flickered upon
their faces, and then grew dim again, leaving their blurred
figures indistinct amid the smoke that diffused pungent,
aromatic odours as it streamed by and vanished between
the towering tree-trunks.</p>
<p>The four men were of widely different type and training,
though it was characteristic of the country that they
sat and talked together on terms of perfect equality.
Two of them were exiles, by fault and misfortune, from
their natural environment. One had forced himself upwards
by daring and mechanical genius into a station
to which, in one sense, he did not belong, and Mattawa,
the chopper, alone, pursued the occupation which had always
been familiar to him. Still, it was as comrades that
they lived together in the wilderness, and, what was more,
had they come across one another afterwards in the cities,
they would have resumed their intercourse on exactly
the same footing. After all, they were, in essentials,
very much the same, and, when that is the case, the barriers
men raise between themselves do not count for
much in the West, at least. Wheeler, the pulp-mill
builder, who had once sold oranges on the railroad cars,
led up to a conversation that gave Nasmyth an opportunity
for which he had been waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Mattawa are about through with that
slashing contract,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You will not net a great
pile of money out of it, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My share is about thirty,&#8221; answered Nasmyth, with
a little laugh. &#8220;My partner draws a few dollars more.
He got in a week when the big log that rolled on my cut
leg lamed me. I seem to have a particularly unfortunate
habit of hurting myself. Are you going back to Ontario
when we get that money, Mattawa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the big axeman replied slowly; &#8220;anyway, not
yet, though I was thinking of it. The ticket costs too
much. They&#8217;ve been shoving up their Eastern rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to have a few dollars in hand,&#8221; remarked
Nasmyth, who was quite aware that this was not exactly
his business. &#8220;Are you going to start a ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa appeared to smile. &#8220;I have one half cleared
back in Ontario.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what d&#8217;you come out here for?&#8221; Gordon
broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;To give the boy a show. He&#8217;s quite smart, and we
were figuring we might make a doctor or a surveyor of
him. That costs money, and wages are &#8217;way higher here
than they are back East.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a simple statement, made very quietly by a
simple man, but it appealed forcibly to those who heard
it, for they could understand what lay behind it. Love
of change or adventure, it was evident, had nothing to
do with sending the grizzled Mattawa out to the forests
of the West. He had, as he said, merely come there that
his son might be afforded opportunities that he had never
had, and this was characteristic, for it is not often that
the second generation stays on the land. Though teamsters
and choppers to the manner born are busy here
and there, the Canadian prairie is to a large extent broken
and the forest driven back by young men from the Eastern
cities and by exiled Englishmen. Their life is a grim one,
and when they marry they do not desire their children to
continue it. Yet, they do not often marry, since the wilderness,
in most cases, would crush the wives they would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
choose. The men toil on alone, facing flood, and drought,
and frost, and some hate the silence of the winter nights
during which they sit beside the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; inquired Wheeler, &#8220;who runs the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wife and the boy. That is, when the boy&#8217;s not
chopping or ploughing for somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were reasons why Nasmyth was stirred by what
he had heard, and with his pipe he pointed to Mattawa,
as the flickering firelight fell upon the old axeman&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the man who didn&#8217;t want his
wages when I offered them to him, though he knew it
was quite likely he would never get them afterwards
unless I built the dam. He&#8217;d been working for me two
or three months then, in the flooded river, most of the
while. Now, is there any sense in that kind of man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa appeared disconcerted, and his hard face
flushed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I felt I had to see you
through.&#8221; He hesitated for a moment with a gesture
which seemed deprecatory of his point of view. &#8220;It
seemed up to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard him,&#8221; said Gordon dryly. &#8220;He&#8217;s from
the desolate Bush back East, and nobody has taught him
to express himself clearly. The men of that kind are
handiest with the axe and drill, but it has always seemed
to me that the nations are going to sit round and listen
when they get up and speak their mind some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw the smile in Nasmyth&#8217;s eyes, and turned to
Wheeler, who was from the State of Washington. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a solid fact that you, at least, can understand. It&#8217;s not
so very long since your folks headed West across the Ohio,
and it&#8217;s open to anyone to see what you have done.&#8221;
Then he flung his hand out towards the east. &#8220;They
fancy back yonder we&#8217;re still in the leading-strings, and
it doesn&#8217;t seem to strike them that we&#8217;re growing big
and strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was characteristic that Wheeler did not grin, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Nasmyth certainly did. What Gordon had said was, no
doubt, a trifle flamboyant, but it expressed the views of
others in the West, and after all it was more or less warranted.
Mattawa, however, gazed at them both as if such
matters were beyond him, and Wheeler, who turned to
Nasmyth, changed the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what are you going to strike next?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth took out his pipe, and carefully filled it before
he answered, for he knew that his time had come,
and he desired greatly to carry his comrades along with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;a notion in my mind, or,
anyway, the germ of one, for the thing will want some
worrying out. It&#8217;s quite a serious undertaking. To begin
with, I&#8217;ll ask Gordon who cut these drains we&#8217;ve been
falling into, and what he did it for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An Englishman,&#8221; Gordon answered. &#8220;Nobody
knew much about him. He was probably an exile, too.
Anyway, he saw this valley, and it seemed to strike him
that he could make a ranch in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should he fix on this particular valley?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing&#8217;s plain enough. How many years does a
man usually spend chopping a clearing out of the Bush?
Isn&#8217;t there a demand for anything that you can eat from
our miners and the men on our railroads and in our
mills? Why do we bring carloads of provisions in? Can&#8217;t
you get hold of the fact that a man can start ranching
right away on natural prairie, if he can once get the
water out of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; assented Nasmyth. &#8220;The point is that
one has to get the water out of it. I would like Mattawa
and Wheeler to notice it. You can go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;that man pitched right in, and
spent most of two years cutting four-foot trenches through
and dyking up the swamp. He went on every day from
sun-up to dark, but every time the floods came they beat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
him. When he walked over the range to the settlement,
the boys noticed he was getting kind of worn and thin,
but there was clean grit in that man. He&#8217;d taken hold
of the contract, and he stayed with it. Then one day
a prospector went into the valley after a big freshet and
came across his wrecked shanty. The river had got him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler nodded gravely. &#8220;It seems to me this country
was made by men like that,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;They&#8217;re
the kind they ought to put up monuments to.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment or two after that,
except for the sighing of the wind among the firs and
the hoarse murmur that came up, softened by the distance,
from the ca&ntilde;on. It was not an unusual story, but it
appealed to those who heard it, for they had fought with
rock and river and physical weariness, and they could
understand the grim patience and unflinching valour of
the long struggle that had resulted, as such struggles
sometimes do, only in defeat. Still, the men who take
those tasks in hand seldom capitulate. Gordon glanced
at Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you have anything to say, you can
get it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth raised himself on one elbow. &#8220;That Englishman
put up a good fight, but he didn&#8217;t start quite
right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to point out that, in my opinion,
the river has evidently just run into the ca&ntilde;on. It&#8217;s slow
and deep until you reach the fall, where it&#8217;s merely held
up by the ridge of rock the rapid runs across. Well,
we&#8217;ll call the change of level twelve to sixteen feet, and,
as Gordon has suggested, a big strip of natural prairie is
apt to make a particularly desirable property, once you
run the water out of it. You can get rid of a lot of water
when you have a fall of sixteen feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to get it?&#8221; asked Wheeler.</p>
<p>&#8220;By cutting the strip of rock that holds the river up
at the fall. I think one could do it with giant-powder.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>Again there was silence for a few moments, and Nasmyth
looked at his comrades quietly, with the firelight
on his face and a gleam in his eyes. They sat still and
stared at him, for the daring simplicity of his conception
won their admiration. Mattawa slowly straightened himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great idea,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Seen something
quite like it in Ontario; I guess it can be done.&#8221; He
turned to Nasmyth. &#8220;You can count me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler made a sign of concurrence. &#8220;It seems to
me that Mattawa is right. In a general way, I&#8217;m
quite open to take a share in the thing, but there&#8217;s a point
you have to consider. Most of the work could be done
only at low water, and a man might spend several years
on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Nasmyth simply.</p>
<p>Wheeler waved his hand. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re
like that other Englishman, but you want to look at this
thing from a business point of view. Now, as you know,
the men who do the toughest work on this Pacific slope
are usually the ones who get the least for it. Well, if
you run the river down, you&#8217;ll dry out the whole valley,
and you&#8217;ll have every man with a fancy for ranching
jumping in, or some d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; land agency&#8217;s dummies grabbing
every rod of it. It&#8217;s Crown land. Anybody can
locate a ranch on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to buy the land,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t pre-empt it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does that count?&#8221; Wheeler persisted. &#8220;If you
started clearing a Bush ranch, you&#8217;d spend considerably
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. &#8220;I fancy our views coincide. The
point is that the Crown agents charge the usual figure
for land that doesn&#8217;t require making, which is not the
case in this particular valley. Well, before I cut the
first hole with the drill, they will either have to sell me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
all I can take up on special terms, or make me a grant
for the work I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon laughed. &#8220;Are you going to hammer your
view of the matter into the Crown authorities? Did
you ever hear of anyone who got them to sanction a
proposition that was out of the usual run?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to try. If they
won&#8217;t hear reason, I&#8217;ll start a syndicate round the settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler, leaning forward, dropped a hand on his shoulder.
&#8220;Count on me for a thousand dollars when you
want the money.&#8221; He turned and looked at Gordon.
&#8220;It&#8217;s your call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll raise the same amount,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;though
I&#8217;ll have to put a mortgage on the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa made a little diffident gesture. &#8220;A hundred&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
the most I can do&ndash;&ndash;but there&#8217;s the boy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled in a curious way, for he knew this
offer was, after all, a much more liberal one than those
the others had made.</p>
<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; he said severely, &#8220;will be on wages. Yet, if
we put the thing through, you will certainly get your
share.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked round at the other two, and after they had
expressed their approval, they discussed the project until
far into the night, and finally decided to recross the
range, and look at the fall again, early next morning.
It happened, however, that Mattawa, who went down to
the river for water, soon after sunrise, found a Siwash
canoe neatly covered with cedar branches. This was not
an astonishing thing, since the Indians, who come up the
rivers in the salmon season, often hew out a canoe on
the spot where they require it, and leave it there until
they have occasion to use it again. After considering the
matter at breakfast, the four men decided to go down the
ca&ntilde;on. They knew that one or two Indians were supposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
to have made the hazardous trip, but that appeared
sufficient, for they were all accustomed to handling a
canoe, and an extra hazard or two is not often a great
deterrent to men who have toiled in the Bush.</p>
<p>They had a few misgivings when the hills closed about
them as they slipped into the shadowy entrance of the
ca&ntilde;on. No ray of sunlight ever streamed down there, and
the great hollow was dim and cold and filled with a thin
white mist, though a nipping wind flowed through it.
For a mile or two the hillsides, which rose precipitously
above them, were sprinkled here and there with climbing
pines, that on their far summits cut, faintly green, against
a little patch of blue. By-and-by, however, the canoe
left these slopes behind, and drifted into a narrow rift
between stupendous walls of rock, though there was a
narrow strip of shingle strewn with whitened driftwood
between the side of the ca&ntilde;on and the river. Then this
disappeared, and there was only the sliding water and the
smooth rock, while the patch of sky seemed no more than
a narrow riband of blue very high above.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the river flowed smoothly between its barriers
of stone, and, sounding with two poles lashed together,
the men got no bottom, and as the river swept
them on, they began to wonder uneasily how they were to
get back upstream. Once, indeed, Wheeler suggested
something of the kind, but none of the others answered
him, and he went on with his paddling.</p>
<p>At last a deep, pulsating roar that had been steadily
growing louder, swelled suddenly into a bewildering din,
and Mattawa shouted as they shot round a bend. There
was a whirling haze of spray into which the white rush
of a rapid led close in front of them, and for the next
minute they paddled circumspectly. Then Mattawa ran
the canoe in between two boulders at the head of the
rapid, and they got out and stood almost knee-deep in
the cold water. The whirling haze of spray which rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
and sank was rent now and then as the cold breeze swept
more strongly down the ca&ntilde;on, and it became evident that
the rapid was a very short one. The walls of rock stood
further apart at this point, and there was a strip of thinly-covered
shingle and boulders between the fierce white
rush of the flood and the worn stone. Mattawa grinned
as the others looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m staying here to hang on to the canoe,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Guess you don&#8217;t feel quite like going down that fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>They certainly did not, and they hesitated a moment
until Nasmyth suddenly moved forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came here to look at the fall, and I&#8217;m going
on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They went with him, stumbling over the shingle, and
now and then floundering among the boulders, with the
stream that frothed about their thighs almost dragging
their feet from under them. Each of them gasped with
sincere relief when he scrambled out of the whirling pool.
They reached a strip of uncovered rock that stretched
across part of the wider hollow above the fall, and stood
there drenched and shivering for several minutes, scarcely
caring to speak as they gazed at the channel which the
stream had cut through the midst of it. Wheeler dropped
his hand on Nasmyth&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said&ndash;&ndash;and Nasmyth could just hear him
through the roar of the fall&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;it seems to me the thing
could be done if you have nerve enough. Still, I guess
if they let you have the whole valley afterwards, you&#8217;d
deserve it.&#8221; Then he seemed to laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make my
share one thousand five hundred dollars. In the meanwhile,
if you have no objections, we&#8217;ll get back again.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>WISBECH MAKES INQUIRIES</h3>
</div>
<p>A little pale sunshine shone down into the opening
between the great cedar trunks when Laura Waynefleet
walked out of the shadowy Bush. The trail from
the settlement dipped into the hollow of a splashing
creek, just in front of her, and a yoke of oxen, which
trailed along a rude jumper-sled, plodded at her side. The
sled was loaded with a big sack of flour and a smaller
one of sugar, among other sundries which a rancher who
lived farther back along the trail had brought up from the
settlement in his waggon. Waynefleet&#8217;s hired man was
busy that morning, and as her stores were running out,
Laura had gone for the goods herself. Other women
from the cities have had to accustom themselves to driving
a span of oxen along those forest trails.</p>
<p>The beasts descended cautiously, for the slope was steep,
and Laura was half-way down it when she saw that a
man, who sat on the little log bridge, was watching her.
He was clearly a stranger, and, when she led the oxen
on to the bridge, tapping the brawny neck of one with a
long stick, he turned to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me if Waynefleet&#8217;s ranch is near here?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>Laura glanced at him sharply, for there was no doubt
that he was English, and she wondered, with a faint
uneasiness, what his business was. In the meanwhile
the big, slowly-moving beasts had stopped and stood still,
blowing through their nostrils and regarding the stranger
with mild, contemplative eyes. One of them turned its
head towards the girl inquiringly, and the man laughed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&#8220;One could almost fancy they wondered what I was
doing here,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ranch is about a mile in front of you,&#8221; said
Laura in answer to his question. &#8220;You are going there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I want to see Miss Waynefleet.
They told me to ask for her at the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura looked at him again with some astonishment.</p>
<p>He was a little man, apparently about fifty, plainly
dressed in what appeared to be English clothing. Nothing
in his appearance suggested that he was a person of any
importance, or, indeed, of much education, but she liked
the way in which he had laughed when the ox had turned
towards her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;as that is my name, you need
not go any further.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man made a little bow. &#8220;Mine&#8217;s Wisbech, and
I belong to the Birmingham district, England,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;I walked over from the settlement to make a
few inquiries about a relative of mine called Derrick
Nasmyth. They told me at the store that you would
probably know where he is, and what he is doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura was conscious of a certain resentment against the
loquacious storekeeper. It was disconcerting to feel that
it was generally recognized that she was acquainted with
Nasmyth&#8217;s affairs, especially as she realized that the fact
might appear significant to his English relative. It would
scarcely be advisable, she decided, to ask the stranger to
walk on to dinner at the ranch, since such an invitation
would probably strengthen any misconceptions he might
have formed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Nasmyth is expecting you?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Wisbech&ndash;&ndash;and a little twinkle, which she
found vaguely reassuring, crept into his eyes&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t
think he is. In all probability he thinks I am still in
England. Perhaps, I had better tell you that I am going
to Japan and home by India. It&#8217;s a trip a good many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
English people make since the C.P.R. put their new
Empress steamers on, and I merely stopped over at Victoria,
thinking I would see Derrick. He is, as perhaps
I mentioned, a nephew of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a certain frankness and something whimsical
in his manner which pleased the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have walked from the settlement?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; answered Wisbech. &#8220;It is rather a long
time since I have walked as much, and I found it quite
far enough. A man is bringing a horse up to take me
back, but I am by no means at home in the saddle. That&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and
he laughed&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;is, I suppose, as great an admission
in this country as I have once or twice found it to be at
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura fancied she understood exactly what he meant.
Most of her own male friends in England were accustomed
to both horses and guns, and this man certainly
did not bear the unmistakable stamp that was upon his
nephew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then my father and I would be pleased if you will
call at the ranch and have dinner with us,&#8221; she said,
and continued a trifle hastily: &#8220;Anyone who has business
at a ranch is always expected to wait until the next meal
is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech, who declared that it was evidently a hospitable
land, and that he would be very pleased, went on with
her; but he asked her nothing about Nasmyth as they
walked beside the plodding oxen. Instead, he appeared
interested in ranching, and Laura, who found herself
talking to him freely and naturally, supplied him with
considerable information, though she imagined once or
twice that he was unobtrusively watching her. He also
talked to Waynefleet and the hired man, when they had
dinner together at the ranch, and it was not until the
two men had gone back to their work that he referred to
the object he had in hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I understand that my nephew spent some time here,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>Laura admitted that this was the case, and when he
made further inquiries, related briefly how Nasmyth had
first reached the ranch. She saw the man&#8217;s face grow intent,
as he listened, and there was a puzzling look in
his eyes, which he fixed upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you took him in and nursed him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
wonder if I might ask why you did it? He had no
claim on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our neighbours would have done the same,&#8221;
Laura answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That hardly affects the case. I presume he was practically
penniless?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why you should seem so sure of that. As
a matter of fact, he had rather more than thirty dollars
in his possession when he set out from the logging camp,
but on the journey he lost the belt he kept the money
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>A queer light crept into Wisbech&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;That is
just the kind of thing one would expect Derrick Nasmyth
to do. You see, as I pointed out, he is my nephew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not have lost that belt?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech laughed. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I certainly would
not. What I meant to suggest was that I am naturally
more or less acquainted with Derrick Nasmyth&#8217;s habits.
In fact, I may admit I was a little astonished to hear
he had contrived to accumulate those thirty dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura did not know exactly why she felt impelled to
tell him about the building of the dam, but she did so,
and made rather a stirring story of it. She was, at
least, determined that the man should realize that his
nephew had ability, and it is possible that she told him
a little more than she had intended, for Wisbech was
shrewd. Then it suddenly flashed upon her that he had
deliberately tricked her into setting forth his nephew&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
strong points, and was pleased that she had made the
most of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dam seems to have been rather an undertaking,
and I am glad he contrived to carry it through successfully,&#8221;
he commented. Then he looked at her with a
twinkle in his eyes. &#8220;I do not know yet where he got
the idea from.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flushed. This was, she felt, regrettable, but
she could not help it, for the man&#8217;s keenness was disconcerting,
and she was, also, a little indignant with him.
She had recognized that Derrick Nasmyth&#8217;s character had
its defects, but she was by no means prepared to admit
it to his relatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it didn&#8217;t occur to you that an idea of that kind
was likely to appeal to your nephew?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; declared Wisbech, &#8220;to be candid, it didn&#8217;t.&#8221; He
smiled again. &#8220;After all, I don&#8217;t think we need trouble
about that point, especially as it seems he has acquitted
himself very well. I, however, can&#8217;t help feeling it was
in some respects fortunate that he fell into your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura was usually composed, but he saw her face
harden, for she was angry at his insistence. &#8220;It is evident,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;that he would not have had the opportunity
of building the dam unless you had nursed him
back to health and taken him into your employment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my father who asked him to stay on at the
ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not sure that the correction has any very great
significance. One would feel tempted to believe that your
father is, to some extent, in the habit of doing what you
suggest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura sat still a moment or two. She was certainly
angry with the stranger, and yet, in spite of that fact,
she felt that she liked him. There was a candour in his
manner which pleased her, as his good-humoured shrewdness
did, though she would have preferred not to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
the shrewdness exercised upon herself. It may be that
he guessed what she was thinking, for he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Waynefleet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I almost fancy we should
make excellent friends, but there is a point on which I
should like you to enlighten me. Why did you take
the trouble to make me understand that you were doing
nothing unusual when you asked me to dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if one must be
accurate, I do not exactly know. I may have been a
little unwise in endeavouring to impress it on you. Why
did you consider it worth while to explain you had very
seldom been in the saddle?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech&#8217;s manner became confidential. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fact
that has counted against me now and then. Besides, I
think you noticed my accent&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s distinctly provincial,
and not like yours or Derrick&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;as soon as I told you
I was a relative of his. You see, I know my station. In
fact, I&#8217;m almost aggressively proud of it.&#8221; He spread out
his hands in a forceful fashion. &#8220;It&#8217;s a useful one.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached out, and, to the girl&#8217;s surprise, took up a
bowl from the table, and appeared to weigh it in his hands.
It was made of the indurated fibre which is frequently
to be met with in the Bush ranches.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is, I suppose, the kind of thing they
are going to turn out at that wood-pulp mill. You have
probably observed the thickness of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is, though they are going to make paper
stock, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; pursued Wisbech; &#8220;it may meet the requirements
of the country, but it is a very crude and inartistic
production. I may say that it is my business to make
enamelled ware. The Wisbech bowls and cups and basins
are justly celebrated&ndash;&ndash;light and dainty, and turned out
to resemble marble, granite, or the most artistic china.
They will withstand any heat you can subject them to,
and practically last for ever.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>He broke off for a moment with a chuckle. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
detach myself from my business as some people seem to
fancy one ought to do. After all, it is only by marriage
that Derrick Nasmyth is my nephew.&#8221; His manner became
grave again. &#8220;I married his mother&#8217;s sister&ndash;&ndash;very
much against the wishes of the rest of the family. As
Derrick has lived some time here, the latter fact will
probably not astonish you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura said nothing, though she understood exactly what
he meant. She was becoming more sure that she liked the
man, but she realized that she might not have done so
had she met him before she came out to Canada, where
she had learned to recognize the essential points in character.
There were certainly respects in which his manner
would once have jarred upon her.</p>
<p>Her expression was reassuring when he turned to her
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a retail chemist in a little pottery town when
I discovered the properties of one or two innocuous
fluxes, and how to make a certain leadless glaze,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Probably you do not know that there were few more
unhealthy occupations than the glazing of certain kinds
of pottery. I was also fortunate enough to make a good
deal of money out of my discovery, and as I extended
its use, I eventually started a big enamelling works of my
own. After that I married; but the Nasmyths never
quite forgave me my little idiosyncrasies and some of my
views. They dropped me when my wife died. She&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;his
face softened curiously&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;was in many ways very
different from the rest of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off, and when he sat silent a moment or
two Laura felt a curious sympathy for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you go on?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had no children,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;My own folks
were dead, but I contrived to see Derrick now and then.
My wife had been very fond of him, and I liked the lad.
Once or twice when I went up to London he insisted on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
making a fuss over me&ndash;&ndash;took me to his chambers and his
club, though I believe I was in several ways not exactly
a credit to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura liked the little twinkle that crept back into his
eyes. It suggested the genial toleration of a man with
a nature big enough to overlook many trifles he might
have resented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;his father died suddenly, and,
when it became evident that his estate was deplorably involved,
Derrick went out to Canada. None of his fastidious
relatives seemed inclined to hold out a hand to
him. Perhaps this was not very astonishing, but I was
a little hurt that he did not afford me the opportunity.
In one way, however, the lad was right. He was willing
to stand on his own feet. There was pluck in him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made an expressive gesture. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m anxious to
hear where he is and what he is doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura was stirred by what he had said. She had
imagination, and could fill in many of the points Wisbech
had only hinted at. Nevertheless, she was not quite
pleased to recognize that he seemed to consider her as
much concerned about his nephew as he was himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;she tried to speak in an indifferent tone&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;He
is at present engaged in building a difficult trestle
bridge on a railroad. It is not the kind of work any
man, who shrank from hazardous exertion, would delight
in; but I believe there is a reason why the terms offered
were a special inducement. He has a new project in his
mind, though I do not know a great deal about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you might tell me what you do know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura did so, though she had never been in the ca&ntilde;on.
The man listened attentively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I fancy I can promise that he shall,
at least, have an opportunity of putting that project
through. You haven&#8217;t, however, told me where the railroad
bridge is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl made him understand how he could most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
easily reach it, and, while she was explaining the various
roads he must follow, there was a beat of hoofs outside.
Wisbech rose and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect that is the man with my horse, and I&#8217;m
afraid I have kept you talking a very long while.&#8221; He
pressed her hand as he half apologized. &#8220;I wonder if
you will permit me to come back again some time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura said it would afford her and her father pleasure,
and she did not smile when he went out and scrambled
awkwardly into his saddle. The man who had brought
the horse up grinned broadly as he watched Wisbech jolt
across the clearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that man&#8217;s not going to make the settlement
on that horse. He rides &#8217;most like a bag of flour,&#8221; he
remarked, with evident enjoyment of the stranger&#8217;s poor
horsemanship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>ON THE TRESTLE</h3>
</div>
<p>It was with difficulty that Wisbech reached the railroad
track upon which Laura Waynefleet had told him
Nasmyth was occupied. From the winding waggon-road,
he was forced to scramble down several hundred feet
through tangled undergrowth, and over great fallen logs.
Then he had to walk along the ties, which were spaced
most inconveniently apart, neither far enough for a long
stride nor close enough for a short one. It is, in fact,
unless one is accustomed to it, a particularly wearying
thing to walk any distance along a Western railroad
track; since local ticket rates are usually high on the Pacific
slope, and roads of any other kind are not always
available, the smaller ranchers and other impecunious
travellers frequently tramp miles upon the ties.</p>
<p>Wisbech, however, had not very far to go, and, though
it entailed an occasional stumble, he endeavoured to look
about him. He was progressing along the side of the
wonderful Fraser gorge, which is the great channel clearly
provided by Nature for the commerce of the mountain
province, and he was impressed by the spectacle upon which
he gazed. In front of him rose great rocky ramparts, with
here and there a snow-tipped peak cutting coldly white
against the glaring blue. Beneath these the climbing
pines rolled down in battalions to the brink of a vast hollow,
in the black depths of which the river roared far
below. Wisps of gauzy mist clung to the hillside, and
out of them the track came winding down, a sinuous
gleaming riband that links the nations with a band of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
steel. There were, as he knew, fleet steamers ready at
either end of it, in Vancouver Inlet, and at Montreal, two
thousand four hundred odd miles away, for this was the
all-British route round half the world from London to
Yokohama and Hong-Kong.</p>
<p>That fact had its effect on Wisbech as he plodded
painfully along the ties. He had Democratic notions,
but he was an Imperialist, too, which was, perhaps, after
all, not surprising, for he knew something of England&#8217;s
great dependencies. There are a good many men with
similar views in the Dominion, and they have certainly
lived up to them. Men undoubtedly work for money
in Western Canada, but one has only to listen to their
conversation in saloon and shanty to recognize the clean
pride in their manhood, and their faith in the destiny of
the land to which they belong. They have also proved
their faith by pitting their unshrinking courage and splendid
physical strength against savage Nature, and, among
their other achievements, that track blown out of the
living rock, flung over roaring rivers, and driven through
eternal snow, supplies a significant hint of what they can
bear and do. They buried mangled men in roaring ca&ntilde;on
and by giddy trestle, but the rails crept always on.</p>
<p>Wisbech came to the brink of a gorge which rent the
steep hillside. He could not tell how deep it was, but it
made him dizzy to look down upon the streak of frothing
water far below. The gorge was spanned by the usual
Western trestle bridge, an openwork fabric of timber just
wide enough to carry the single track rising out of the
chasm on tapering piers that looked ethereally fragile in
that wilderness of towering trees and tremendous slopes
of rock. The chunk of axes and ringing of hammers
jarred through the roar of the stream, and he could see
men clinging in mid-air to little stages slung about the
piers, and moving among the pines below. A man in a
ragged duck suit strode by him with an axe on his shoulder,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
and Wisbech half-diffidently ventured to inquire if
he could tell where Derrick Nasmyth could be found.
The man, who paid no attention to him, stopped close by,
and shouted to some of his comrades below.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to get that beam fixed before the fast
freight comes through, boys. There&#8217;s no sign of her yet,&#8221;
he called in a loud voice.</p>
<p>Somebody answered him, and the man turned to
Wisbech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, sir,&#8221; he replied tardily, &#8220;you were asking for
Nasmyth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech said he wished to see Derrick Nasmyth, and
the man nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have to wait a few minutes,
I guess he&#8217;s busy. There&#8217;s a log they want to put into
the trestle before the train comes along. It&#8217;s not his
particular business, but we&#8217;re rather anxious to get
through with our contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; returned Wisbech, &#8220;then I fancy I know who
you must be. In fact, I&#8217;m rather glad I came across you.
You are evidently the man who looked after my nephew
when he was ill, and from what Miss Waynefleet told
me, Derrick owes you a good deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon looked at Wisbech with a little smile, as he recalled
what Nasmyth had said about the man who had
sent him the draft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he remarked, as he pointed to the hillside,
&#8220;it would be quite hard to fancy there was very much
the matter with him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech agreed with Gordon when he saw a man, who
was running hard, beside four brawny oxen that were
hauling a great dressed fir-log by a chain. They came
from an opening between the pines, and rushed along the
rude trail, which had a few skids across it. The trail led
downhill just there, and man and oxen went down the
slope furiously in the attempt to keep ahead of the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
log that jolted over the skids behind them. Wisbech had
never seen cattle of any kind progress in that fashion before,
but he naturally did not know that the Bush-bred
ox can travel at a headlong pace up and down hills and
amidst thickets a man would cautiously climb or painfully
crawl through. As they approached the level at the
foot of the slope, the man who drove them ran back, and
slipping his handspike under it, swung the butt of the log
round an obstacle. Wisbech gazed at his nephew with
astonishment when Nasmyth came up with the beasts
again. His battered wide hat was shapeless, his duck
trousers were badly rent, and the blue shirt, which was all
he wore above the waist, hung open half-way down his
breast. He was flushed and gasping, but the men upon
the trestle were evidently urging him to fresh exertion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hit her hard!&#8221; shouted one of them; and a
comrade clinging to a beam high above the river broke in:
&#8220;We&#8217;re waiting. Get a hump on. Bring her right
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was evident that Nasmyth was already doing all that
reasonably could have been expected of him, and in another
moment or two, four more men, who ran out of the
Bush, fell upon the log with handspikes, as the beasts
came to a long upward slope. They went up it savagely,
and Wisbech was conscious of a growing amazement as he
watched the floundering oxen and gasping men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you always work&ndash;&ndash;like this?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Gordon laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t the
bosses&#8217; fault when we don&#8217;t. As it happens, however, a
good many of us are putting a contract through, and the
boys want to get that beam fixed before the fast freight
comes along. If they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s quite likely she&#8217;ll shake
it loose or pitch some of them off the bridge. It has stood
a few years, and wants stiffening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years!&#8221; said Wisbech. &#8220;There are bridges
in England that have existed since the first railways were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
built. I believe they don&#8217;t require any great stiffening
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Gordon. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite what one would
expect. We do things differently. We heave our rails
down and fill up the country with miners and farmers
while you&#8217;d be worrying over your parliamentary bills.
We strengthen our track as we go along, and we&#8217;ll have
iron bridges over every river just as soon as they&#8217;re
wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech smiled. It seemed to him that these men
would probably get exactly what they set their minds
upon in spite of every obstacle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they stop the train while they get the
beam into place?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing short of a big landslip is allowed to hold
that fast freight up,&#8221; Gordon replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to every
divisional superintendent between here and Winnipeg to
rush her along as fast as possible. Half the cars are
billed through to the Empress liner that goes out to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the men and oxen had conveyed the
big log up the slope, and, while Nasmyth drove the beasts
back along the skidded track, it swung out over the
chasm at the end of a rope. Men leaning out from
fragile stages clutched at and guided it, and when one of
them shouted, Nasmyth cast the chain to which the rope
was fastened loose from his oxen. Then little lithe figures
crawled out along the beams of the trestle, and
there was a ringing of hammers. Gordon, who gazed
up the track, swung his arm up in warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to hump yourselves, boys,&#8221; he admonished.</p>
<p>The faint hoot of a whistle came ringing across the
pines, and a little puff of white smoke broke out far up
the track from among their sombre masses. It grew
rapidly larger, and the clang of the hammers quickened,
while Wisbech watched the white trail that swept along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
the steep hillside until there was a sudden shouting.
Then he turned and saw his nephew running across the
bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody has forgotten a bolt or a big spike,&#8221; said
Gordon.</p>
<p>Wisbech felt inclined to hold his breath as he watched
Nasmyth climb down the face of the trestle, but in another
minute or two he was clambering up again with
several other men behind him. There was another hoot
of the whistle, and, as Wisbech glanced up the track, a
great locomotive broke out from among the pines. It
was veiled in whirling dust and flying fragments of
ballast, and smoke that was grey instead of white, for the
track led down-grade, and the engineer had throttled the
steam. The engine was a huge one, built for mountain
hauling, and the freight cars that lurched out of the forest
behind it were huger still. Wisbech could see them rock,
and the roar which they made and which the pines flung
back grew deafening. Most of the cars had been coupled
up in the yards at Montreal, and were covered thick with
the dust that had whirled about them along two thousand
four hundred miles of track, and they were still speeding
on through the forests of the West, as they had done
through those of far-off Ontario.</p>
<p>It seemed to Wisbech as he gazed at the cars that they
ran pigmy freight trains in the land he came from, and
he was conscious of something that had a curious stirring
effect on him in the clang and clatter of that giant rolling
stock, as the engineer hurled his great train furiously
down-grade. It was man&#8217;s defiance of the wilderness, a
symbol of his domination over all the great material
forces of the world. The engineer, who glanced out
once from his dust-swept cab, held them bound and
subject in the hollow of the grimy hand he clenched upon
the throttle. With a deafening roar, the great train leapt
across the trestle, which seemed to rock and reel under it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
and plunged once more into the forest. A whistle
sounded&ndash;&ndash;a greeting to the men upon the bridge&ndash;&ndash;and
then the uproar died away in a long diminuendo among
the sombre pines.</p>
<p>It was in most respects a fortuitous moment for Wisbech&#8217;s
nephew to meet him, and the older man smiled as
Nasmyth strode along the track to grasp his outstretched
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Derrick,&#8221; said Wisbech, who
drew back a pace and looked at his nephew critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have changed since I last shook hands with you
in London, my lad,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t wear
blue duck, and you hadn&#8217;t hands of that kind then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced at his scarred fingers and broken
nails.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been up against it, as they say here, since those
days,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it has done you a world of good!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;perhaps it has.
Any way, that&#8217;s not a point we need worry over just
now. Where have you sprung from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech told him, and added that there were many
things he would like to talk about, whereupon Nasmyth
smiled in a deprecatory manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to wait an hour or two,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You see, there are several more big logs ready for
hauling down, and I have to keep the boys supplied. I&#8217;ll
be at liberty after supper, and you can&#8217;t get back to-night.
In the meanwhile you might like to walk along to where
we&#8217;re getting the logs out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech went with him and Gordon, and was impressed
when he saw how they and the oxen handled the giant
trunks. He, however, kept his thoughts to himself, and,
quietly smoking, sat on a redwood log, a little, unobtrusive,
grey-clad figure, until Gordon, who had disappeared
during the last hour, announced that supper was ready.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
Then Wisbech followed Nasmyth and Gordon to their
quarters, which they had fashioned out of canvas, a few
sheets of corrugated iron, and strips of bark, for, as their
work was on the hillside, they lived apart from the regular
railroad gang. The little hut was rudely comfortable, and
the meal Gordon set out was creditably cooked. Wisbech
liked the resinous scent of the wood smoke that hung
about the spot, and the faint aromatic odour of the pine-twig
beds and roofing-bark. When the meal was over,
they sat a while beneath the hanging-lamp, smoking and
discussing general topics, until Nasmyth indicated the
canvas walls of the hut and the beds of spruce twigs with
a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse your quarters. They&#8217;re rather
primitive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wisbech&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;I almost think I shall feel
as much at home as I did when you last entertained me
at your club, and I&#8217;m not sure that I don&#8217;t like your new
friends best,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The others were a trifle patronizing,
though, perhaps, they didn&#8217;t mean to be. In fact,
it was rather a plucky thing you did that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint flush crept into Nasmyth&#8217;s bronzed face, but
Wisbech smiled reassuringly as he glanced about the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is what all this is leading to,&#8221; he observed
with inquiry in his tone.</p>
<p>Gordon rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go along and talk to the boys,&#8221; he
announced. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be back for an hour or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced at Wisbech before he turned to his
comrade.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would sooner you stayed where you are,&#8221; he said.
Then he answered Wisbech. &#8220;In the first place, if we
are reasonably fortunate, it should lead to the acquisition
of about a couple of hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said Wisbech, &#8220;that will not go very far.
What will be the next thing when you have got the
money?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In a general way, I should endeavour to earn a few
more dollars by pulling out fir-stumps for somebody or
clearing land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech nodded. &#8220;No doubt they&#8217;re useful occupations,
but one would scarcely fancy them likely to prove
very remunerative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have, it seems to
me, reached an age when you have to choose. Are you
content to go on as you are doing now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s face flushed as he saw the smile in Gordon&#8217;s
eyes, for it was evident that Wisbech and Laura Waynefleet
held much the same views concerning him. They
appeared to fancy that he required a lot of what might
be termed judicious prodding. This was in one sense not
exactly flattering, but he did not immediately mention his
great project for drying out the valley. He would not
hasten to remove a wrong impression concerning himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; resumed Wisbech, seeing he did not answer,
&#8220;if you care to go back and take up your profession in
England again, I think I can contrive to give you a fair
start. You needn&#8217;t be diffident. I can afford it, and the
thing is more or less my duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth sat silent. There was no doubt that the
comfort and refinement of the old life appealed to one
side of his nature, and there were respects in which his
present surroundings jarred on him. It is also probable
that, had the offer been made him before he had had a
certain talk with Laura Waynefleet, he would have profited
by it, but she had roused something that was latent
in him, and at the same time endued him with a vague
distrust of himself, the effect of which was largely beneficial.
He had realized then his perilous propensity for
what she had called drifting, and, after all, men of his
kind are likely to drift fastest when everything is made
pleasant for them. It was characteristic that he looked
inquiringly at Gordon, who nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you ought to go, if it&#8217;s only for a year or two,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
said Gordon. &#8220;It&#8217;s the life you were born to. Give it
another trial. You can come back to the Bush again if
you find it fails.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth appeared to consider this, and the two men
watched him intently, Wisbech with a curious expression
in his shrewd eyes. Then, somewhat to their surprise,
Nasmyth broke into a little harsh laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;That there is a possibility of my failing seems sufficient,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Here I must fight. I am, as we say, up
against it.&#8221; He turned to Wisbech. &#8220;Now if you will
listen, I will tell you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the next few minutes he described his project for
running the water out of the valley, and when he sat
silent again there was satisfaction in Wisbech&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Wisbech, &#8220;I am going to give you your
opportunity. It&#8217;s a thing I insist upon, and, as it happens,
I&#8217;m in a position to do it more or less effectually.
I have letters to folks of some importance in Victoria&ndash;&ndash;Government
men among others&ndash;&ndash;and you&#8217;ll go down there
and live as you would have done in England just as long
as appears advisable while you try to put the project
through. It is quite evident that you will have to get
one of the land exploitation concerns to back you, and no
doubt a charter or concession of some kind will have to
be obtained from the Crown authorities. The time you
spend over the thing in Victoria should make it clear
where your capacities lie&ndash;&ndash;if it&#8217;s handling matters of this
kind in the cities, or leading your workmen in the Bush.
I purpose to take a share in your venture, and I&#8217;m offering
you an opportunity of making sure which is the kind of
life you&#8217;re most fitted for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you ought to go,&#8221; remarked Gordon quietly.</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. &#8220;That,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;is my own
opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll consider it as decided,&#8221; said Wisbech.
&#8220;It seems to me I could spend a month or two in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
province very satisfactorily, and we&#8217;ll go down to Victoria
together, as soon as you have carried out this timber-cutting
contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked of other matters, while now and then men
from the railroad gang dropped in and made themselves
pleasant to the stranger. It must be admitted that there
are one or two kinds of wandering Englishmen, who
would not have found them particularly friendly, but the
little quiet man with the twinkling eyes was very much
at home with them. He had been endued with the gift
of comprehension, and rock-cutter and axeman opened
their minds to him. In fact, he declared his full satisfaction
with the entertainment afforded him before he lay
down upon his bed of springy spruce twigs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>IN THE MOONLIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>There was a full moon in the clear blue heavens,
and its silvery light streamed into the pillared
veranda where Nasmyth sat, cigar in hand, on the seaward
front of James Acton&#8217;s house, which stood about
an hour&#8217;s ride from Victoria on the Dunsmer railroad.
Like many other successful men in that country, Acton
had begun life in a three-roomed shanty, and now, when,
at the age of fifty, he was in possession of a comfortable
competence, he would have been well content to retire to
his native settlement in the wilderness. There was, however,
the difficulty that the first suggestion of such a course
would have been vetoed by his wife, who was an ambitious
woman, younger than he, and, as a rule, at least, Acton
submitted to her good-humouredly. That was why he
retained his seat on several directorates, and had built
Bonavista on the bluff above the Straits of Georgia, instead
of the ranch-house in the Bush he still hankered for.</p>
<p>Bonavista had cost him much money, but Mrs. Acton
had seen that it was wisely expended, and the long wooden
house, with its colonnades of slender pillars, daintily sawn
scroll-work, shingled roof, and wide verandas, justified
her taste. Acton reserved one simply furnished room in
it for himself, and made no objections when she filled the
rest of it with miscellaneous guests. Wisbech had
brought him a letter from a person of consequence, and
he had offered the Englishman and his nephew the freedom
of his house. He would not have done this to everybody,
though they are a hospitable people in the West, but
he had recognized in the unostentatious Wisbech one or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
two of the characteristics that were somewhat marked in
himself, and his wife, as it happened, extended her favour
to Nasmyth as soon as she saw him. She had been quick
to recognize something she found congenial in his voice
and manner, though none of the points she noticed would
in all probability have appealed to her husband. Acton
leaned upon the veranda balustrade, with a particularly
rank cigar in his hand, a gaunt, big-boned man in badly-fitting
clothes. It was characteristic of him that he had
not spoken to Nasmyth since he stepped out from one of
the windows five minutes earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of pretty,&#8221; he said, indicating the prospect
with a little wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Nasmyth admitted that it was pretty indeed, and
his concurrence was justified. Sombre pinewoods and
rocky heights walled in the wooden dwelling, but in front
of it the ground fell sharply away, and beyond the shadow
of the tall crags a blaze of moonlight stretched eastwards
athwart the sparkling sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Acton, &#8220;it&#8217;s &#8217;most as good a place for a
house as I could find anywhere the cars could take me
into town, and that&#8217;s partly why we raised it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he glanced down at the little white steamer lying
in the inlet below. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of my own particular
toys. You&#8217;re coming up the coast with us next week for
the salmon-trolling?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said that he did not know what his uncle&#8217;s
intentions were, but he was almost afraid they had trespassed
on their host&#8217;s kindness already. Acton laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have folks here for a month quite often&ndash;&ndash;folks
that I can&#8217;t talk to and who don&#8217;t seem to think it worth
while to talk to me. Now I can get along with your
uncle; I can mostly tell that kind of man when I see him.
You have got to let him stay some weeks yet. It would
be in one way a kindness to me. What makes the thing
easier is the fact that Mrs. Acton has taken to you, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
when she gets hold of anyone she likes, she doesn&#8217;t let
him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth was content to stay, and he felt that it would
be a kindness to his host. Acton appeared willing to fall
in with the views of his wife, but Nasmyth fancied that
he was now and then a little lonely in his own house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of you have done everything you could to make
our stay pleasant,&#8221; Nasmyth declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite easy in your case,&#8221; and a twinkle crept
into his host&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Your uncle&#8217;s the same kind of a
man as I am, and one can see you have been up against it
since you came to this country. That&#8217;s one of the best
things that can happen to any young man. I guess it&#8217;s
not our fault we don&#8217;t like all the young men they send
us out from the Old Country.&#8221; He glanced down at his
cigar. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve pretty well smoked this thing out.
It&#8217;s the kind of cigar I was raised on, but I&#8217;m not allowed
to use that kind anywhere in my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another moment Acton swung round, and stepped
back through an open window. He generally moved
abruptly, and was now and then painfully direct in conversation,
but Nasmyth had been long enough in that
country to understand and to like him. He was a man
with a grip of essential things, but it was evident that he
could bear good-humouredly with the views of others.</p>
<p>Nasmyth sat still after Acton left him. There were
other guests in the house, and the row of windows behind
him blazed with light. One or two of the big casements
were open, and music and odd bursts of laughter drifted
out. Somebody, it seemed, was singing an amusing song,
but the snatches of it that reached Nasmyth struck him
as pointless and inane. He had been at Bonavista a week,
but, after his simple, strenuous life in the Bush, he felt
at times overwhelmed by the boisterous vivacity with
which his new companions pursued their diversions.
There are not many men without an occupation in the
West, but Mrs. Acton knew where to lay her hands on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
them, and her husband sometimes said that it was the folks
who had nothing worth while to do who always made the
greatest fuss. But Nasmyth found it pleasant to pick up
again the threads of the life which he had almost come to
the conclusion that he had done with altogether. It was
comforting to feel that he could sleep as long as he liked,
and then rise and dress himself in whole, dry garments,
while there was also a certain satisfaction in sitting down
to a daintily laid and well-spread table when he remembered
how often he had dragged himself back to his tent
almost too worn out to cook his evening meal. On the
whole, he was glad that Acton had urged him to remain
another week or two.</p>
<p>Then he became interested as a girl stepped out of one
of the lighted windows some little distance away, and,
without noticing him, leaned upon the veranda balustrade.
The smile in her eyes, he fancied, suggested a certain satisfaction
at the fact that what she had done had irritated
somebody. Why it should do so he did not know, but it
certainly conveyed that impression. In another minute a
man appeared in the portico, and the manner in which he
moved forward, after he had glanced along the veranda,
was more suggestive still. The girl who leaned on the
balustrade no doubt saw him, and she walked towards
Nasmyth, whom, apparently, she had now seen for the
first time. Nasmyth thought he understood the reason
for this, and, though it was not exactly flattering to himself,
he smiled as he rose and drew forward another chair.
He believed most of Mrs. Acton&#8217;s guests were acquainted
with the fact that he was an impecunious dam-builder.</p>
<p>The girl, who sat down in the chair he offered, smiled
when he flung his half-smoked cigar away, and Nasmyth
laughed as he saw the twinkle in her eyes, for he had
stopped smoking with a half-conscious reluctance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really was a pity, especially as I wouldn&#8217;t have
minded in the least,&#8221; she observed.</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced along the veranda, and saw that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
man, who had discovered that there was not another chair
available, was standing still, evidently irresolute. Probably
he recognized that it would be difficult to preserve a
becoming ease of manner in attempting to force his company
upon two persons who were not anxious for it, and
were sitting down. Nasmyth looked at the girl and prepared
to undertake the part that he supposed she desired
him to play. She was attired in what he would have described
as modified evening dress, and her arms and neck
gleamed with an ivory whiteness in the moonlight. She
was slight in form, and curiously dainty as well as pretty.
Her hair was black, and she had eyes that matched it, for
they were dark and soft, with curious lights in them, but,
as she settled herself beside him in the pale moonlight it
seemed to him that &#8220;dainty&#8221; did not describe her very
well. She was rather elusively ethereal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t think you could expect me to make any
admission of that kind about my cigar, Miss Hamilton,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Still, it would perhaps have been excusable.
You see, I have just come out of the Bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet Hamilton smiled. &#8220;You are not accustomed
to throw anything away up there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth, with an air of reflection;
&#8220;I scarcely think we are. Certainly not when it&#8217;s a cigar
of the kind Mr. Acton supplies his guests with.&#8221;</p>
<p>He imagined that his companion satisfied herself that
the man she evidently desired to avoid had not gone away
yet, before she turned to him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you risking Mrs. Acton&#8217;s displeasure in sitting
out here alone?&#8221; she inquired. &#8220;You are probably aware
that this is not what she expects from you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost think the retort is obvious.&#8221; And Nasmyth
wondered whether he had gone further than he intended,
when he saw the momentary hardness in his companion&#8217;s
eyes. It suggested that the last thing her hostess had expected
her to do was to keep out of the way of the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
who had followed her on to the veranda. He accordingly
endeavoured to divert her attention from that subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any way, I find all this rather bewildering now and
then,&#8221; he said, and indicated the lights and laughter and
music in the house behind him with a little movement of
his hand. &#8220;This is a very different world from the one
I have been accustomed to, and it takes some time to adapt
oneself to changed conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off as he saw the other man slowly turn away.
He looked at the girl with a smile. &#8220;I can go on a little
longer if it appears worth while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet Hamilton laughed. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;one
should never put one&#8217;s suspicions into words like that.
Besides, I almost think one of your observations was a
little misleading. There are reasons for believing that
you are quite familiar with the kind of life you were referring
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was clear to Nasmyth that she had been observing
him, but he did not realize that she was then watching
him with keen, half-covert curiosity. He was certainly a
well-favoured man, and though his conversation and demeanour
did not differ greatly from those of other young
men she was accustomed to; there was also something
about him which she vaguely recognized as setting him
apart from the rest. He was a little more quiet than
most of them, and there were a certain steadiness in his
eyes, and a faint hardness in the lines of his face, which
roused her interest. He had been up against it, as they
say in that country, which is a thing that usually leaves
its mark upon a man. It endues him with control, and,
above all, with comprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a man not burdened with money is
now and then forced to wander. He naturally picks up a
few impressions here and there. I wonder if you find it
chilly sitting here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl rose, with a little laugh. &#8220;That,&#8221; she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
&#8220;was evidently meant to afford me an opportunity. I
think I should like to go down to the Inlet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth, who understood this as an invitation, went
with her, and, five minutes later, they strolled out upon
the crown of the bluff, down the side of which a little
path wound precipitously. Nasmyth held his hand out
at the head of it, and they went down together cautiously,
until they stood on the smooth white shingle close by
where the little steamer lay. The girl looked about her
with a smile of appreciation.</p>
<p>A lane of dusky water, that heaved languidly upon
the pebbles, ran inland past them under the dark rock&#8217;s
side, and it was very still in the shadow of the climbing
firs. On the further shore a flood of silvery radiance,
against which the dark branches cut black as ebony,
streamed down into the rift, and beyond the rocky gateway
there was brilliant moonlight on the smooth heave of
sea. The girl glanced at it longingly, and then, though
she said nothing, her eyes rested on a little beautifully
modelled cedar canoe that lay close by. In another moment
Nasmyth had laid his hands on it, and she noticed how
easily he ran it down the beach, as she had noticed how
steady of foot he was when she held fast to his hand as
they came down the bluff. With a curious little smile
that she remembered afterwards, he glanced towards the
shadowy rocks which shut in the entrance to the Inlet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we go and see what there is out yonder beyond
those gates?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; replied the girl, &#8220;what could there be? Aren&#8217;t
you taking an unfair advantage in appealing to our
curiosity?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a whimsical gesture as he answered
her, for he saw that she could be fanciful, too. &#8220;Unsubstantial
moonlight, glamour, mystery&ndash;&ndash;perhaps other
things as well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you are curious, why
shouldn&#8217;t we go and see?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>She made no demur, and helping her into the canoe, he
thrust the light craft off, and, with a sturdy stroke of the
paddle, drove it out into the Inlet. It was a thing he was
used to, for he had painfully driven ruder craft of that
kind up wildly-frothing rivers, and the girl noticed the
powerful swing of his shoulders and the rhythmic splash
of his paddle, though there were other things that had
their effect on her&ndash;&ndash;the languid lapping of the brine on
shingle, and the gurgle round the canoe, that seemed to
be sliding out towards the moonlight through a world of
unsubstantial shadow. She admitted that the man interested
her. He had a quick wit and a whimsical fancy
that appealed to her, but he had also hard, workman&#8217;s
hands, and he managed the canoe as she imagined one
who had undertaken such things professionally would
have done.</p>
<p>When the shimmering blaze of moonlight lay close in
front of them, he let his paddle trail in the water for a
moment or two, and, turning, glanced back at the house
on the bluff. Its lower windows blinked patches of warm
orange light against the dusky pines.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in one respect typifies all you are
accustomed to. It stands for the things you know.
Aren&#8217;t you a little afraid of leaving it behind you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I suggested that you were accustomed to
them, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was turned
out of that world a long while ago. We are going to
see a different one together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned the man reflectively, &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite
sure that I do. It&#8217;s the one I live in, but that doesn&#8217;t
go very far after all. Now and then I think one could
live in the wilderness a lifetime without really knowing
it. There&#8217;s an elusive something in or behind it that
evades one&ndash;&ndash;the mystery that hides in all grandeur and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
beauty. Still, there&#8217;s a peril in it. Like the moonlight,
it gets hold of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl fancied that she understood him, but she
wondered how far it was significant that they should slide
out into the flood of radiance together when he once more
drove the light craft ahead.</p>
<p>The smooth sea shimmered like molten silver about the
canoe, and ran in sparkling drops from the dripping paddle.
The bluff hung high above them, a tremendous
shadowy wall, and the sweet scent of the firs came off
from it with the little land breeze. They swung out
over the smooth levels that heaved with a slow, rhythmic
pulsation, and Nasmyth wondered whether he was wise
when he glanced at his companion. She sat still, looking
about her dreamily, very dainty&ndash;&ndash;almost ethereal, he
thought&ndash;&ndash;in that silvery light, and it was so long since he
had talked confidentially to a woman of her kind, attired
as became her station. Laura Waynefleet&#8217;s hands, as he
remembered, were hard and sometimes red, and the stamp
of care was plain on her; but it was very different with
Violet Hamilton. She was wholly a product of luxury
and refinement, and the mere artistic beauty of her attire,
which seemed a part of her, appealed to his imagination.</p>
<p>He did not remember how she set him talking, but he
told her whimsical, and now and then grim, stories of
his life in the shadowy Bush, and she listened with
quick comprehension. She seemed to endow him with
that quality, too, since, as he talked, he began to
realize, as he had never quite comprehended before, the
something that lay behind the tense struggle of man with
Nature and all the strenuous endeavour. Perhaps he
expressed it in a degree, for now and then the girl&#8217;s eyes
kindled as he told of some heroic grapple with giant
rock and roaring river, gnawing hunger, and loneliness,
and the beaten man&#8217;s despair. He found her attention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
gratifying. It was certainly pleasant, though he had
not consciously adopted the pose, to figure in the eyes
of such a girl as one who had known most of the hardships
that man can bear and played his part in the great
epic struggle for the subjugation of the wilderness. As
it happened, she did not know that those who bear the
brunt of that grim strife are for the most part dumb.
Their share is confined to swinging the axe and gripping
the jarring drill.</p>
<p>It was an hour after they left the Inlet when the land
breeze came down a little fresher, and swinging the canoe
round, he drove it back over a glittering sea that commenced
to splash about the polished side of the light craft.
Then both of them ceased talking until, as they approached
the shadowy rift in the rock, the girl looked back with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is almost a pity to leave all that behind,&#8221; she said
softly.</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded as he glanced up at the lighted windows
of the house. &#8220;In one sense it is. Still, it&#8217;s rather
curious that I think I never appreciated it quite so much
before.&#8221; He let his paddle trail as he wondered whether
he had gone too far. &#8220;I suppose you are going up the
coast with Mrs. Acton in the steamer?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Violet Hamilton, with an air of reflection;
&#8220;I was not quite sure whether I would or not,
but now I almost think I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth was sensible of a little thrill of satisfaction,
for he knew it was understood at Bonavista that he was
going too. He decided that he could certainly go. He
dipped his paddle strongly, and laughed as they slid forward
into the shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are safely back in your own
realm again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You called it a world a little while ago,&#8221; said the
girl.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; replied Nasmyth. &#8220;Still, I almost think the
word I substituted is justifiable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet Hamilton said nothing as they climbed the
bluff, but she wondered how far the change he had made
was significant. All the men at Bonavista were her subjects,
but until that night, at least, Nasmyth had in that
sense stood apart from them, and it is always more or less
gratifying to extend one&#8217;s sovereignty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>MARTIAL&#8217;S MISADVENTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>There was not a breath of wind, and the night was
soft and warm, when Nasmyth lay stretched upon
the <i>Tillicum&#8217;s</i> deck, with his shoulder against the saloon
skylights and a pipe in his hand. The little steamer lay
with her anchor down under a long forest-shadowed
point, behind which a half-moon hung close above the
great black pines. Some distance astern of her, a schooner
lay waiting for a wind with the loose folds of her big
mainsail flapping black athwart the silvery light, and her
blinking anchor-light flung a faint track of brightness
across the sliding tide. There was only the soft lap of
the water along the steamer&#8217;s side and the splash of the
little swell upon the beach to break the stillness, for the
sea was smooth as oil.</p>
<p>The <i>Tillicum</i> would not have compared favourably
with an English steam-yacht. She had been built for the
useful purpose of towing saw-logs, and was sold cheap
when, as the mill she kept supplied grew larger, she
proved too small for it. Acton, however, was by no
means a fastidious person, and when he had fitted her with
a little saloon, and made a few primitive alterations below,
he said she was quite good enough for him. For
that matter, anyone fond of it might navigate the land-locked
waters of Puget Sound and the Straits of Georgia
in an open whaleboat with satisfaction in summer-time.
There are islands everywhere, wonderful rock-walled inlets
that one can sail into, beaches to which the primeval
forest comes rolling down, and always above the blue
waters tower tremendous ramparts of never-melting snow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>On the evening in question, Acton was not on board.
He had taken his wife and guests ashore that morning
for an excursion to a certain river where there was excellent
trout-fishing, and, as a hotel had lately been built
for the convenience of sportsmen visitors, it was uncertain
whether they would return that night. Nasmyth had
not made one of the party because there was scarcely room
for everybody in the gig, and six miles, which was the
distance to the river mouth, was rather far to row in the
dinghy. Another guest called Martial also had been
left behind, and afterwards had been rowed ashore to
visit a ranching property somewhere in the neighbourhood.
He was the man who had followed Miss Hamilton out
on to the veranda one night, and Nasmyth, who did not
like him, understood that he was connected with a big
land exploitation agency.</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt more or less contented with everything,
as he lay upon the <i>Tillicum&#8217;s</i> deck listening to the faint
murmur of the swell upon the boulder beach. He had
made certain propositions to the Crown lands authorities,
which he believed they would look into, and while he
waited he found the customs and luxuries of civilization
pleasant. He found the society of Violet Hamilton more
pleasant still, and the demeanour of the man, Martial,
was almost the only thing that ruffled him. Martial had
constituted himself Miss Hamilton&#8217;s special attendant,
and though Nasmyth fancied Mrs. Acton connived at this,
it was by no means as evident that the girl was pleased
with it. Indeed, he surmised that she liked the man as
little as he did. Martial was brusque in mariner, and,
though that is not usually resented in British Columbia,
he now and then went even further than is considered
permissible in that country, and he had gained the sincere
dislike of the red-haired George, who acted as the <i>Tillicum&#8217;s</i>
deck-hand, cook, and skipper.</p>
<p>George sat upon the skylights sucking at his pipe, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
it presently became evident that his thoughts and
Nasmyth&#8217;s were very much alike. There was nobody else
on board, for the man who fired and drove the engines
was ashore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you can catch trout?&#8221; the skipper remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; answered Nasmyth indifferently. &#8220;As a
matter of fact, I&#8217;ve had to, when there was very little else
to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>George, who was big and lank, and truculent in appearance,
nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juss so!&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been up against it
in the Bush. Anybody could figure on that by the look
of you and the way you use your hands. A city man
takes holds of things as if they were going to hurt him.
That&#8217;s kind of why I froze on to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth took this as a compliment, and smiled his
acknowledgment, for George was a privileged person,
and most of his recent companions held democratic views.
He, however, said nothing, and George went on again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Acton&#8217;s a mighty smart woman, but she plays
some fool tricks,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the blame
use in taking a boatload of folks after trout when none of
them but the boss knows how to fish?&#8221; Then he chuckled.
&#8220;You&#8217;d have gone with the rest this morning if
she wanted you to. Guess the gig would have carried
another one quite nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth fancied that this was possible, though he naturally
would not admit it to his companion. The fact
that his hostess had somewhat cleverly contrived to leave
him behind had its significance, since it seemed to indicate
that she recognized that Miss Hamilton regarded
him with a certain amount of favour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said George reflectively, &#8220;the boss is quite
smart, too! Mrs. Acton crowded you out of the gig.
The boss says nothing, but he knocks off that blame
Martial. That makes the thing even, and, unless he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
does it, none of them gets any fish. Now, it kind of
seems to me that for a girl like Miss Hamilton to look at
a man like Martial is a throwing of herself away. I guess
it strikes you like that, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was rather too pointed a question for Nasmyth
to answer, but, so far as it went, he could readily have
agreed with the skipper. As a matter of fact it suggested
the query why he should object to Miss Hamilton throwing
herself away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure that it&#8217;s any
concern of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>George&#8217;s grin was expressive of good-natured toleration.
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s plain enough
for me. You&#8217;re not going to talk about the boss&#8217;s friends.
Still, one man&#8217;s as good as another in this country, and, if
I wasn&#8217;t way better than Martial, I&#8217;d drown myself.
That&#8217;s the kind of pernicious insect a decent man has
no use for. What&#8217;s he come on board for with three
bags ram full of clothes, when many a better man
humps his outfit up and down the Bush in an old blanket
same as you have done? It&#8217;s a sure thing that no man
with a conscience wants to get into the land agency business.
It&#8217;s an institution for selling greensuckers ranching
land that&#8217;s rock and gravel and virgin forest. Besides, I
heard the blame insect telling Miss Hamilton that nobody
not raised in the hog-pen could drink my coffee.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed to Nasmyth that there was a little reason in
the skipper&#8217;s observations, though he thought that Martial&#8217;s
strictures upon the coffee accounted for most of
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it might have been wiser if Martial had kept
on good terms with the skipper,&#8221; he laughingly rejoined.</p>
<p>George chuckled softly. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;when
anyone up and says my coffee&#8217;s only fit for the hog-pen,
I&#8217;m going to get even with him. I kind of feel I have
to. It&#8217;s up to me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>He said nothing further for some little time, and
Nasmyth, who fancied that he would sooner or later
carry out his amiable intentions, lay prone upon the deck
smoking placidly. Nasmyth was one who adapted himself
to his environment with readiness, and on board the
<i>Tillicum</i> the environment was particularly comfortable.
Through Acton&#8217;s hospitality, he was brought into contact
with the luxuries of civilization without the galling restraints.
Miss Hamilton had been gracious to him of
late. That was a cause for satisfaction in itself. The
days when he swung the heavy axe, or, drenched with icy
water, stood gripping the drill had slipped far away behind
him. For the time, at least, he could bask in the
sunshine with ears stopped against the shrill trumpet-call
to action that he had heard in the crash of rent trees and
the turmoil of the wild flood.</p>
<p>A faint cry came from the shore out of the stillness of
the woods, and George listened carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;That can&#8217;t be the boss. Guess he&#8217;s stopping at the
hotel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite likely it&#8217;s that blame insect
Martial coming back. Those ranchers he has been trying
to freeze off their holding have no use for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cry rose again, a trifle louder, and George nodded
complacently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he exulted, &#8220;it&#8217;s Martial sure! We&#8217;ll let
him howl. Any way, he can walk down the beach until
he&#8217;s abreast of us. When anybody expects me to hear
him, he has got to come within half a mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed to Nasmyth that Martial would not have a
pleasant walk in the dark, for most of the beach lay in
the black shadow of the pines, and beneath highwater
mark was covered with the roughest kind of boulders.
Above the tide-line, a ragged mass of driftwood interspersed
with undergrowth separated the water from the
tangled Bush. Both George and Nasmyth were aware
that one could readily tear one&#8217;s clothes to pieces in an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
attempt to struggle through such a labyrinth. Judging
by the shouts he uttered at intervals, Martial appeared to
be floundering along the beach, and presently Nasmyth
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He appears to be getting angry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After all,
it&#8217;s only natural that he doesn&#8217;t want to sleep in the
woods all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>George filled his pipe, apparently with quiet satisfaction,
but, some time later, he stood up suddenly with an
exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blame contrary insect means swimming off,&#8221; he
announced.</p>
<p>Nasmyth, glancing shorewards, saw a dim white object
crawling on all-fours towards the water where the moonlight
streamed down upon a jutting point, and it was then
that the idea which had results that neither of them anticipated
first dawned on the skipper, who broke into a
hoarse chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he wouldn&#8217;t want Miss Hamilton to see him
like that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some folks look considerably
smarter with their clothes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s she going to see him when she isn&#8217;t here?&#8221;</p>
<p>George grinned again. &#8220;Her dresses are, so&#8217;s her hat
and her little mandolin. If you were pulled in tight
you&#8217;d have quite a figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was clear to Nasmyth that the scheme was workable,
though he was quite aware that the thing he was expected
to do was a trifle discreditable. Still, he had lived for
some time in the Bush, where his comrades&#8217; jests were not
particularly delicate, and Martial once or twice had been
aggressively unpleasant to him. What was more to the
purpose, he felt reasonably sure that Miss Hamilton would
be by no means sorry to be free of Martial, and it was
probable that their victim would never relate his discomfiture,
if their scheme succeeded.</p>
<p>As the result of these reflections he went down with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
George to the little saloon. The skipper, who left him
there a few minutes, came hack with an armful of feminine
apparel. They had no great difficulty in tying on
the big hat with the veil, but when Nasmyth had stripped
his jacket off there was some trouble over the next proceeding.
Indeed, Derrick did not feel quite comfortable
about appropriating Miss Hamilton&#8217;s garments, but he had
committed himself, and it was quite clear that his companion
would not appreciate his reasons for drawing back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your breath while I get this blame hook in,&#8221;
said the skipper.</p>
<p>Nasmyth did so; but he could not continue to hold it
indefinitely, and in a few moments there was a suggestive
crack, and George desisted in evident dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come adrift from the stiffening quite a strip of it,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Well, I guess I can somehow fix the thing up so
as nobody will notice it. It should be easier than putting
a new cloth in a topsail, and I&#8217;ve a mending outfit in the
locker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth was by no means sure of George&#8217;s ability to
make the damage good, but he permitted the skipper to
tie on the loose skirt, and then to hang the beribboned
mandolin round his neck. When this was done George
surveyed him with a grin of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said George, &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll do. Now you&#8217;ll
keep behind the skylights, and only get up and bang that
mandolin when Martial wants to come on board. Guess
when he sees you he&#8217;ll feel &#8217;most like jumping right out
of his skin. Miss Hamilton&#8217;s not going to mind. I&#8217;ve
seen her looking at him as if she&#8217;d like to stick a big hatpin
into him.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went up, and Nasmyth, who felt guilty as he
crouched in the shadow, could see a black head and the
flash of a white arm that swung out into the moonlight
and disappeared again. Martial was swimming pluckily,
and the tide was with him, for his head grew larger every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
minute, and presently the gleam of his skin became visible
through the pale shining of the brine. His face dipped as
his left arm came out at every stroke, and the water
frothed as his feet swung together like a flail. He paddled
easily while the tide swept him on until he reached
the <i>Tillicum</i>. Then his voice rose, breathless and cautious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anchor watch,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Anybody else on
board?&#8221;</p>
<p>George, who kept out of sight, did not answer. Martial
called again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let anybody out of the companion while I get
up,&#8221; he commanded.</p>
<p>The <i>Tillicum</i> had a high sheer forward, and he could
not reach her rail, but as the tide swept him along he
raised himself to clutch at it where it was lower abreast
of the skylights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said George softly, &#8220;you can play the band.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth rose and swept his knife-haft across the
strings of the mandolin. For a moment he saw something
like horror in Martial&#8217;s wet face, and then the man,
who gasped, went down headforemost into the water.
Martial was nearly a dozen yards astern when his head
came out again, and he slid away with the tide, with his
white arm swinging furiously. George sat down upon
the deck, and expressed his satisfaction by drumming his
feet upon the planking while he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Might have a high-power
engine inside of him. Guess he&#8217;s going to scare those
schooner men &#8217;most out of their lives. It&#8217;s quite likely
they won&#8217;t keep anchor watch when they&#8217;re lying snug
in a place of this kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth managed to control his laughter, and went
down to divest himself of his draperies. When he came
up again, George reported that he had just seen Martial
crawling up the schooner&#8217;s cable, and in another few moments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
what appeared to be a howl of terror rose from the
vessel. It was not repeated, and shortly afterwards
Nasmyth went to sleep.</p>
<p>Martial remained on board the schooner that night,
and Nasmyth was not surprised when he failed to appear
next morning. Acton had come back with his party when
a man dropped into the boat astern of the schooner, and
pulled towards the <i>Tillicum</i> leisurely. Everybody was
on deck when he slid alongside, and, standing up in his
boat, laid hold of the rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a message for Mr. Acton,&#8221; he said, holding up
a strip of paper.</p>
<p>Acton, who took the paper from him, was a trifle perplexed
when he glanced at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that Martial didn&#8217;t stay at that ranch last
night as I thought he had done,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton, who sat next to Miss Hamilton, looked
up sharply. She was a tall woman with an authoritative
manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone back to Victoria,&#8221; said her husband, who
handed her the note. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of sudden, and he doesn&#8217;t
worry about saying why he went. There&#8217;s a little remark
at the bottom that I don&#8217;t quite like.&#8221;</p>
<p>George naturally had been listening, and Nasmyth
saw his subdued grin, but he saw also Mrs. Acton&#8217;s quick
glance at Miss Hamilton, which seemed to suggest that
she surmised the girl could explain why Martial had departed
so unceremoniously. There was, however, only astonishment,
and, Nasmyth fancied, a trace of relief in
Violet Hamilton&#8217;s face. Mrs. Acton turned to her husband
with a flush of resentment in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should scarcely have believed Mr. Martial would
ever write such a note,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What does he mean
when he says that he does not appreciate being left to
sleep in the woods all night?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; answered Acton, &#8220;is what I don&#8217;t quite understand.
If he&#8217;d hailed anchor watch loud enough,
George would have gone off for him. Still, we&#8217;re lying
quite a way out from the beach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he remembered the man from the schooner, who
still gripped the rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come to get this note?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who came off last night gave it to the skipper,&#8221;
said the schooner&#8217;s deck-hand with a very suggestive
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d he come off?&#8221; Acton asked. &#8220;Did you go
ashore for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;He must have swum
off and crawled up the cable. Any way, when he struck
the skipper he hadn&#8217;t any clothes on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little murmur of astonishment, and Mrs.
Acton straightened herself suddenly, while Nasmyth saw
a gleam of amusement creep into Acton&#8217;s eyes. The
schooner man evidently felt that he had an interested
audience, for he leaned upon the rail as he began to tell
all he knew about the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was asleep forward, when the skipper howled as
if he was most scared out of his life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I got
up out of the scuttle just as quick as I could, and there
he was crawling round behind the stern-house with an
axe in his hand, and the mate flat up against the rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Shut that slide quick,&#8217; says the skipper. &#8216;Shut it.
He&#8217;s crawling up the ladder.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I guess you can shut it yourself if you want it shut.&#8217;
He asked for whisky. &#8216;Tell him where it is,&#8217; says the
mate.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doubt that the listeners were interested,
and the man made an impressive gesture. &#8220;It was kind
of scaring. There was a soft flippety-flop going on in the
stern-house, and I slipped out a handspike. Then the
skipper sees me.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s a drowned man crawling round the cabin
with water running off him,&#8217; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then a head came out of the scuttle and a wet arm,
and a voice that didn&#8217;t sound quite like a drowned man&#8217;s
says, &#8216;Oh you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton raised his arm restrainingly, and the narrator
made a sign of comprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;He called us fools,&#8221; the man explained, &#8220;and for
&#8217;most a minute the skipper was going to take the axe to
him. Then he hove it at the mate for being scared instead,
and they all went down together, and I heard them
light the stove. After that I went back and dropped off
to sleep, and the skipper sent me off at sun-up to fetch
the stranger&#8217;s clothes. We set him ashore as soon as he&#8217;d
got some breakfast into him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man rowed away in another minute or two, and,
as he had evidently told his story with a relish, Nasmyth
wondered whether Martial had contrived to offend him
by endeavouring to purchase his silence. There are, of
course, men one can offer a dollar to on that coast, but
such an act requires a certain amount of circumspection.</p>
<p>Acton&#8217;s eyes twinkled, and the men who were his
guests looked at one another meaningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered one of them, &#8220;I guess there is an explanation,
though I didn&#8217;t think Martial was that kind
of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said nothing, but he saw Mrs. Acton&#8217;s face
flush with anger and disdain, and surmised that it was
most unlikely that she would forgive the unfortunate
Martial. The women in the party evidently felt that
it would not be advisable to say anything further about
the matter, and when George broke out the anchor the
<i>Tillicum</i> steamed away.</p>
<p>It was after supper that night, and there was nobody
except the helmsman on deck, when Miss Hamilton approached
the forward scuttle where Nasmyth sat with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
pipe in his hand. Nasmyth rose and spread out an old
sail for her, and she sat down a little apart from him.
The <i>Tillicum</i> was steaming northwards at a leisurely
six knots, with her mastheads swaying rhythmically
through the soft darkness, and a deep-toned gurgling at
her bows. By-and-by Nasmyth became conscious that
Miss Hamilton was looking at him, and, on the whole,
he was glad that it was too dark for her to see him very
well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you were very much astonished at what
you heard about Mr. Martial?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nasmyth reflectively, &#8220;in one way at
least, I certainly was. You see, I did not think Martial
was, as our friend observed, that kind of man. In fact,
I may admit that I feel reasonably sure of it still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you felt you owed him that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to leave you under a misapprehension.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for half a minute, and then Nasmyth
turned towards the girl again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are still a little curious about the affair?&#8221; he
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. I may mention that I found a certain dress
of mine, which I do not remember tearing, had evidently
been repaired by somebody quite unaccustomed to that
kind of thing. Now there were, of course, only the skipper
and yourself on board while we were away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt his face grow hot. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;if it&#8217;s any consolation to you, I am quite prepared, in one
respect at least, to vindicate Martial&#8217;s character. In any
case, I think I shall have an interview with Mrs. Acton
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>His heart beat a little faster, for the girl laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really wouldn&#8217;t be any consolation at all to me,&#8221;
she admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;then, although you may have
certain fancies, you are not dreadfully vexed with me?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>Violet Hamilton appeared to reflect. &#8220;Considering
everything, I almost think you can be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that, they talked about other matters for at least
an hour, while the <i>Tillicum</i>, with engines throbbing
softly, crept on through the darkness, and Acton, who
happened to notice them as he lounged under the companion
scuttle with a cigar in his hand, smiled significantly.
Acton had a liking for Nasmyth, and though he
was not sure that Mrs. Acton would have been pleased
had she known where Miss Hamilton was, the matter
was, he reflected, after all, no concern of his.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>ACTON&#8217;S WARNING</h3>
</div>
<p>It was with somewhat natural misgivings, the next
afternoon, that Nasmyth strolled forward along the
<i>Tillicum&#8217;s</i> deck toward the place where Mrs. Acton was
sitting. Immaculately dressed, as usual, she reclined in
a canvas chair with a book, which she had been reading,
upon her knee. As Nasmyth approached her he became
conscious that she was watching him with a curious expression
in her keen, dark eyes. The steamer had dropped
anchor in a little land-locked bay, and Nasmyth had
just come back in the dinghy, after rowing one or two
of the party ashore. Mrs. Acton indicated with a movement
of her hand that he might sit upon the steamer&#8217;s
rail, and then, turning towards him, looked at him steadily.
She was a woman of commanding personality, and imperiously
managed her husband&#8217;s social affairs. If he
had permitted it, she probably would have undertaken,
also, to look after his commercial interests.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why you decided not to visit the Indian
settlement with the others?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. &#8220;I have been in many places of the
kind,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Besides, there is something I
think I ought to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost fancied that was the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wonder if you have connected me with Martial&#8217;s
disappearance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may admit that my husband evidently has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told you, then?&#8221; And Nasmyth realized next
moment that the faint astonishment he had displayed
was not altogether tactful.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Acton, with a smile, &#8220;he did not.
That was, I think, what made me more sure of it. James
Acton can maintain a judicious silence when it appears
advisable, and there are signs that he rather likes
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth bowed. &#8220;I should be very pleased to hear
that you shared his views in this respect,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, in the meanwhile, somewhat naturally rather
uncertain upon the point,&#8221; she returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; confessed Nasmyth humbly, &#8220;I believe I am
largely responsible for your guest&#8217;s sudden disappearance.
It was, of course, almost inexcusable, and I could not complain
if you were very angry with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should, at least, like to know exactly what you
did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;is a thing I would sooner
you did not urge me to explain. After all, I feel I
have done Martial sufficient injury, and I do not think he
would like you to know. There are,&#8221; he added somewhat
diffidently, &#8220;one or two other reasons why I should
prefer not to say anything further, but I would like to
assure you that the explanation one of your friends suggested
is not the correct one. I ventured to make this,
at least, clear to Miss Hamilton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton regarded him with a suggestive smile.
&#8220;Mr. Martial was not effusively pleasant to you. The
affair was premeditated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My one excuse is that the thing was done on the
spur of the moment. I should never have undertaken
it if I had reflected.&#8221; Nasmyth made a gesture of submission.
&#8220;I am in your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton sat silent for perhaps a minute gazing at
the woods that swept round three sides of the little
bay. Great cedars and pines and hemlocks rolled down
to the water&#8217;s edge, and the stretch of smooth green brine
between them and the steamer flashed like a mirror.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, after a long pause, &#8220;I must admit
that at first I was angry with you. Now&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and her
eyes grew a bit scornful&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I am angry with Martial,
instead. In fact, I think I shall wash my hands of him.
I have no sympathy with a man who allows himself to be
placed in a ludicrously painful position that reflects upon
his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially when he has the privilege of your particular
favour,&#8221; added Nasmyth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton laughed. &#8220;That,&#8221; she returned, &#8220;was
a daring observation. It, at least, laid a certain obligation
on Martial to prove it warranted, which he has signally
failed to do. I presume you know why he took some
little pains to make himself unpleasant to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth fancied that she was really angry with Martial,
and that he understood her attitude. She was a
capable, strong-willed woman, and had constituted herself
the ally of the unfortunate man who had brought
discredit on her by permitting himself to be shamefully
driven from the field. It was also evident that she resented
the fact that a guest from her husband&#8217;s yacht
should have been concerned in any proceedings of the
nature that the schooner&#8217;s deck-hand had described.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I suspect why he was not cordial to me,&#8221;
Nasmyth admitted. &#8220;Still, the inference is so flattering
that one would naturally feel a little diffident about believing
that Martial&#8217;s suppositions were correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; replied Mrs. Acton, &#8220;was tactfully expressed.&#8221;
She looked at the young man fixedly, and her
next remark was characterized by the disconcerting frankness
which is not unusual in the West. &#8220;Mr. Nasmyth,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;unless you have considerable means of your
own, it would be wiser of you to put any ideas of the
kind you have hinted at right out of your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might, perhaps, ask you for one or two reasons
why I should adopt the course you suggest.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You shall have them. Violet Hamilton is a lady
with possessions, and I look upon her as a ward of my
own. Any way, her father and mother are dead, and
they were my dearest friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; agreed Nasmyth, &#8220;that naturally renders caution
advisable. Well, I am in possession of three or four
hundred dollars, and a project which I would like to
believe may result to my advantage financially. Still,
that is a thing I cannot be very sure about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton gazed at him thoughtfully. &#8220;Your uncle
is a man of means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he is. He may put three or four thousand
dollars into the venture I mention, if he continues pleased
with me. That is, I think, the most I could expect
from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton sat silent a while, and, though Nasmyth was
not aware of it, favoured him with one or two glances of
careful scrutiny. He was, as she had naturally noticed,
a well-favoured man, and the flannels and straw hat
he wore were becoming to him. What was more to the
purpose, there was a certain graceful easiness in his voice
and manner which were not characteristic of most of her
husband&#8217;s friends. Indeed, well-bred poise was not a characteristic
of her own, though she recognized her lack. The
polish that she coveted suggested an acquaintance with a
world that she had not as yet succeeded in persuading her
husband to enter. Acton was, from her point of view, regrettably
contented with his commercial status in the new
and crudely vigorous West.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she remarked thoughtfully, &#8220;none of us knows
what there is in the future, and there are signs that you
have intelligence and grit in you.&#8221; Then she dismissed
the subject. &#8220;I think you might take me for a row,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth pulled the dinghy alongside, and rowed her up
and down the bay, but his intelligence was, after all, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
sufficient for him to recognize the cleverness with which
she led him on to talk about his uncle and England. He
was not aware that he had been particularly communicative,
but when he rowed back to the yacht Mrs. Acton
was in possession of a great deal of information that was
more or less satisfying.</p>
<p>The <i>Tillicum</i> steamed away again when the remainder
of the party arrived, and she was leisurely swinging over
a little froth-flecked sea that night, with the spray flying
at her bows, when Acton came upon Nasmyth leaning on
the rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t quite certain what view Mrs. Acton might
take of Martial&#8217;s disappearance,&#8221; said Acton. &#8220;Just now,
however, I think that she is rather pleased with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact,&#8221; replied Nasmyth, &#8220;is naturally a cause
for satisfaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton appeared amused. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to some
extent it depends upon what views she has for you. Mrs.
Acton is a capable woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton strolled forward, leaving Nasmyth thoughtful.
The hint was reasonably plain, but the younger man was
not quite sure that he would be willing to fall in with the
strong-willed woman&#8217;s views. There was no doubt that
Violet Hamilton attracted him&ndash;&ndash;he admitted that without
hesitation&ndash;&ndash;for she had grace and wit and beauty,
but she had, also, large possessions, which might prove a
serious obstacle. Besides, he was sensible of a tenderness
for the woman who had given him shelter and a great
deal more than that in the lonely Bush. Laura, however,
was still in the wilderness, and Miss Hamilton, whose
society he found very pleasant, was then on board the
<i>Tillicum</i>, facts that had their significance in the case of
a man liable to be swayed by the impulses of the moment.
By-and-by, he started, for while he thought about her,
Miss Hamilton came out of the little companion-way, and
stood looking round her, with her long light dress rustling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
in the breeze, until she moved forward as her eyes rested
on him.</p>
<p>Nasmyth fancied that there was a particular significance
in the fact that she appeared just then. He walked to
meet her, and, drawing a low canvas chair into the shelter
of the skylights, sat down with his back against them close
at her feet. He did not remember what they talked about,
and it was in all probability nothing very material, but
they had already discovered that they had kindred views
and likes, and they sat close together in the shelter of the
skylights with a bright half-moon above them, while the
<i>Tillicum</i> lurched on over a glittering sea. Both of them
were surprised to discover that an hour had slipped by
when their companions came up on deck, and Nasmyth
was once more thoughtful before he went to sleep that
night.</p>
<p>Next day the <i>Tillicum</i> brought up off a little mining
town, and George, who went ashore, came back with
several letters. Among the letters was a note for Nasmyth
from a man interested in land exploitation. This man,
with whom Nasmyth had been in communication, was
then in the mining town, and he suggested that Nasmyth
should call upon him at his hotel. Nasmyth showed
Acton the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand these folks are straight?&#8221; the younger
man remarked with inquiry in his tone.</p>
<p>Acton smiled dryly. &#8220;Any way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they&#8217;re as
straight as most. It&#8217;s not a business that&#8217;s conducive to
unswerving rectitude. Hutton has come up here to see
you about the thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he has some other business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Acton, &#8220;perhaps he has.&#8221; Then he
turned to Wisbech, who sat close by. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go ashore
with Nasmyth. Will you come along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Wisbech; &#8220;I almost think I&#8217;ll stay where
I am. If Derrick can hold out any reasonable prospect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
of making interest on the money, it&#8217;s quite possible I
may put three or four thousand dollars into the thing,
but I go no further. It&#8217;s his affair. He must handle it
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s sensible, in one way,&#8221; he declared,
and one could have fancied there was a certain
suggestiveness in the qualification.</p>
<p>Wisbech appeared to notice it, for he looked hard
at Acton. Then he made an abrupt gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my nephew&#8217;s affair,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; returned Acton, significantly. &#8220;Any way,
I&#8217;ll go ashore with him, as soon as George has the gig
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton and Nasmyth were rowed off together half an
hour later, and they walked up through the hot main
street of the little colliery town. It was not an attractive
place, with rickety plank sidewalks raised several
feet above the street, towering telegraph-poles, wooden
stores, and square frame houses cracked by the weather,
and mostly destitute of any adornment or paint. Blazing
sunshine beat down upon the rutted street, and an unpleasant
gritty dust blew along it.</p>
<p>There was evidently very little going on in the town
that afternoon. Here and there a man leaned heavy-eyed,
as if unaccustomed to the brightness, on the balustrade
in front of a store, and raucous voices rose from
one or two second-rate saloons, but there were few other
signs of life, and Nasmyth was not sorry when they
reached the wooden hotel. Acton stopped a moment in
front of the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hutton&#8217;s an acquaintance of mine, and if you have
to apply to men of his kind, he is, perhaps, as reliable
as most,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Still, you want to remember that
in this country it&#8217;s every man for himself, especially
when you undertake a deal in land.&#8221; He smiled suggestively.
&#8220;And now we&#8217;ll go in and see him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>They came upon a man who appeared a little older
than Nasmyth. He was sitting on the veranda, which was
spacious, and had one or two wooden pillars with crude
scroll-work attached to them in front. Acton nodded to
the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Nasmyth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He came up with
me. Doing much round here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was abrupt, but the man smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;we endeavour to do a little
everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll leave you to it, and look round again
by-and-by. I guess I may as well mention that Mr.
Nasmyth is coming back with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton looked hard at Hutton, who smiled again.
&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied Hutton, &#8220;I understand that. It&#8217;s
quite likely we&#8217;ll have the thing fixed up in half an hour
or so. A cigar, Mr. Nasmyth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth took a cigar, and went with Hutton to the
little table which had been set out, on the inner side of
the veranda, with a carafe of ice-water and a couple of
bottles. They sat down at it, and Hutton took out two
letters and glanced at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll get to work. I understand
your proposition is to run the water out of the Cedar
Valley. What&#8217;s the area?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About four thousand acres available for ranching
land, though it has never been surveyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you want to take up as many acres beforehand
as you can, and can&#8217;t quite raise the capital?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said that was very much the state of affairs,
and Hutton drummed his fingers on the table. He was
a lean-faced man, dressed quietly and precisely, in city
fashion, but he wore a big stone in a ring on one hand,
which for no very evident reason prejudiced his companion
against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he averred, &#8220;we might consider going into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
the thing and finding part of the capital. It&#8217;s our business,
but naturally we would want to be remunerated for the
risk. It&#8217;s rather a big one. You see, you would have
to take up the whole four thousand acres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; replied Nasmyth, &#8220;what&#8217;s your proposition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll put up what money you can&#8217;t raise, and our
surveyor will locate land at present first-class Crown
land figure. We&#8217;ll charge you bank rate until the land&#8217;s
made marketable when you have run the water out. In
a general way, that&#8217;s my idea of the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laid down his cigar and looked at him. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
it a little exorbitant? You get the land at cost value,
and a heavy charge on that, while I do the work?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hutton laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s money we&#8217;re
out for, and unless you take it all up, your claim&#8217;s no
good. Anybody else could jump right in and buy a few
hundred acres. Then he could locate water rights and
stop you running down the river, unless you bought him
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficulty is that the Crown authorities haven&#8217;t
been selling land lately, and would sooner lease. They
seem inclined to admit that this is a somewhat exceptional
case; in fact, they have granted me one or two
privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you would call a first option?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth remembered Acton&#8217;s manner when he had
mentioned his acquaintance with his companion, and
one or two things he had said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not exactly that. I merely mentioned
certain privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, what&#8217;s to stop me or anybody going right
down to Victoria and buying the whole thing up to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m inclined to fancy you would discover one or two
things that would make it difficult,&#8221; answered Nasmyth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
dryly. &#8220;For another thing, I hardly think you would
get any of the regular rock-cutting or mine-sinking
people to undertake the work about the fall at a figure
that wouldn&#8217;t make the risk too big. It&#8217;s not a place
that lends itself to modern methods or the use of machinery.
Besides, after approaching you to a certain extent
in confidence, it wouldn&#8217;t be quite the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hutton waved the hand which bore the ring. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll get back to our original offer. If it
isn&#8217;t good enough, how much more do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth explained his views, and they discussed each
proposition point by point, gradually drawing nearer to
an agreement. Nasmyth was quite aware that in a matter
of this kind the man who provides the capital usually
takes the lion&#8217;s share, but, after all, the project was his,
and he naturally wanted something for himself. At
length Hutton leaned forward with both elbows on the
table, and a certain intentness in his lean face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve gone just about as far as I
can. You have either got to close with my proposition
or let it go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said nothing, and there was silence for almost
a minute while he lay back in his chair gazing at
the weather-cracked front of the store across the street,
and thinking hard. There was, he was quite aware, a
very arduous task in front of him&ndash;&ndash;one that he shrank
from at times, for it could only be by strenuous toil
that he could succeed in lowering the level of the river,
and it was clear that if he accepted Mutton&#8217;s offer, his
share of the proceeds would not be a large one. Still,
he must have more capital than he could see the means
of raising, and once or twice he was on the point of
signifying his concurrence. His face grew grimmer, and
he straightened himself a trifle, but he did not see that
the man who could supply the money was watching him
with a smile.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>Then it seemed to Nasmyth that he heard a footstep
in the room behind him, but it was not particularly
noticeable, and Hutton touched his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the promoter, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just run over our
terms again.&#8221; He did so rapidly, and added: &#8220;If that
doesn&#8217;t take you, we&#8217;ll call it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a gesture which was vaguely expressive
of resignation, and in another moment would have closed
the bargain, but the footsteps grew plainer, and, as he
turned round, Acton appeared at the open window close
behind them. He stood still, looking at them with amusement
in his shrewd eyes, and then, stepping out, dropped
heavily into the nearest chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not through yet? I want a drink,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It was probably not often that Hutton was disconcerted,
but Nasmyth saw his fingers close sharply on
his cigar, which crumpled under them, and that appeared
significant to him. Acton looked round again as he filled
his glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re ready we&#8217;ll go along,&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;You can worry out anything Hutton has put before you
to-night. When I&#8217;ve a matter of consequence on hand,
I generally like to sleep on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth rose and turned to Hutton. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
to keep Mr. Acton, and I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t decide just
yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know when I make up my
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hutton made a sign of concurrence, but there was a
suggestive frown on his face, when he leaned upon the
balustrade, as Nasmyth and Acton went down the stairway
together. When they were half-way down the street,
Acton looked at Nasmyth with a dry smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;you have still got most of
the wool on you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed, but there was relief in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very nearly doing what I think would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
been an unwise thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was fortunate you
came along when you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton waved his hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m open to admit that Hutton
has a voice like a boring bit. It would go through
a door, any way. It&#8217;s a thing he ought to remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still a point or two I am not very clear
upon;&#8221; and Nasmyth looked at him steadily.</p>
<p>Acton smiled again. &#8220;The fact is, Mrs. Acton gave
me some instructions concerning you. She said I was to
see you through.&#8221; He made an expressive gesture. &#8220;She
seemed to figure it might be advisable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nasmyth reflectively, &#8220;I fancy she was
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>They said nothing further, but Nasmyth was unusually
thoughtful as they proceeded towards the water-front.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>AN EVENTFUL DAY</h3>
</div>
<p>It was about eleven o&#8217;clock on a cloudy, unsettled morning
when Nasmyth stood knee-deep in a swirling river-pool,
holding a landing-net and watching Miss Hamilton,
who stood on a neighbouring bank of shingle with a light
trout-rod in her hand. The rod was bent, and the thin
line, which was drawn tense and rigid, ripped through
the surface of the pool, while there was also a suggestion
of tension in the pose of the girl&#8217;s figure. She was gazing
at the moving line, with a fine crimson in her cheeks and
a brightness in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to lose it,
after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled reassuringly. &#8220;Keep the butt well
down, and your thumb upon the reel,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;You have only to keep on a steady strain.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big silvery object broke the surface a dozen yards
away, and then, while the reel clinked, went down again;
but the line was moving towards Nasmyth now, and, in
another minute or two, he flung a sharp warning at the
girl as he made a sweep with the net. Then he floundered
ashore, dripping, with the gleaming trout, which he laid
at her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ran that fish very well,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;In fact,
there were one or two moments when I never expected
you to hold it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The colour grew a little plainer in his companion&#8217;s
face, though whether this was due to his commendation
or to elation at her own success was a question. As she
had just caught her first big fish, it was, perhaps, the
latter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said complacently, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t so very difficult
after all. But I wonder what can have become of the
others of our party?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was at least an hour since Nasmyth had last seen
their companions considerably lower down the river. He
and Miss Hamilton had pushed on ahead of them into the
Bush, which was a thing they had fallen into the habit
of doing. The girl sat down on a boulder and seemed
to be listening, but there was nothing to indicate the
presence of any of the party. Except for the murmur
of the river and the sighing among the pine-sprays high
overhead, the Bush was very still, but it seemed to Nasmyth
that there was more wind than there had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we had better go back to them,&#8221; observed
the girl. The manner in which she spoke conveyed the
impression that she would have been more or less contented
to stay where she was with him; but next moment
she added: &#8220;After all, they have the lunch with them,
and it must have been seven o&#8217;clock when we breakfasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;I think it was. Still, until
this minute I had quite forgotten it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Violet Hamilton. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think I ever had breakfast at seven o&#8217;clock in my life
until this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact had its significance to Nasmyth. It was
one of the many little things that emphasized the difference
between his life and hers, but he brushed it out
of his mind, and they went back together down the waterside.
Their progress was slow, for there was no trail
at all, and while they laboriously plodded over the shingle,
or crept in and out among the thickets, the wail of the
breeze grew louder. Half an hour had passed when the
faint hoot of the <i>Tillicum&#8217;s</i> whistle reached them among
the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can the skipper be whistling for?&#8221; asked the
girl.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I fancy the wind is setting inshore moderately fresh,
and he wants us to come off before it roughens the water,&#8221;
said Nasmyth.</p>
<p>They went on as fast as possible after that, though
it was remarkably rough travelling; but they saw no
sign of their companions, and the whistle, which had
shrieked again, was silent, which evidently meant that the
gig had already gone off. When they reached the inlet
the river fell into, and found only the <i>Tillicum&#8217;s</i> dinghy
lying on the shingle, Nasmyth, looking down the lane
of smooth green water somewhat anxiously, noticed that
the sea was flecked with white. The <i>Tillicum</i>, as he remembered,
was also lying well out from the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had better get off at once,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
breeze is freshening, and this dinghy isn&#8217;t very big.&#8221;</p>
<p>He helped the girl into the boat, and when he had
thrust the little craft off sent her flying down the riband
of sheltered water; but he set his lips and braced himself
for an effort when they slid out past a point of froth-lapped
shingle. There was already a white-topped sea running,
and the spray from the oar-blades and the dinghy&#8217;s bows
blew aft into his companion&#8217;s face in stinging wisps as he
drove the plunging craft over it. Now and then an odd
bucketful of brine came in and hit him on the back, while
Miss Hamilton, who commenced to get very wet, shivered
and drew her feet up as the water gathered deeper in the
bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I must ask you to throw some of that
water out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is a can to scoop it up
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl made an attempt to do so, but it was not
surprising that in a few minutes, when the dinghy lurched
viciously, she let the can slip from her fingers. Nasmyth
set his lips tighter, and his face was anxious as he glanced
over his shoulder. The sea was white-flecked between
him and the <i>Tillicum</i>, which lay rolling wildly farther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
down the beach, at least half a mile away. It already
taxed all Nasmyth&#8217;s strength to drive the dinghy off
shore, and every sea that broke a little more sharply than
the rest splashed into the boat. He held on for another
few minutes, glancing over his shoulder and pulling
cautiously, for it was evident that he might fill the dinghy
up or roll her over if he failed to swing neatly over the
crest of some tumbling comber. In spite of his efforts,
a wave broke on board, and sitting ankle-deep in water,
he waited until there was a slightly smoother patch in
front of him, and then swung the dinghy round.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have to make for the beach,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>He would have preferred to head for the inlet, but
that would have brought the little white seas, which
were rapidly getting steeper, dangerously on her beam,
and the thrust of one beneath her side probably would
have been sufficient to turn the diminutive craft over.
He accordingly pulled straight for the beach before the
wind, and the perspiration dripped from his set face as
he strove to hold the dinghy straight, when, with the foam
boiling white about her, she swung up on the crest of a
comber. Once or twice Nasmyth glanced at Violet Hamilton
reassuringly, but she sat, half-crouching, against
the transom, gazing forward, white in face, with her wet
hair whipping about her. Nasmyth had not noticed it
before, but her hat had evidently gone over. Speech was
out of the question. He wanted all his breath, and recognized
that it was not advisable to divert his attention for
a moment from his task, for it depends very largely upon
the man at the oars whether a diminutive dinghy keeps
right side uppermost in any weight of breeze. Once or
twice he risked a glance at the approaching land.</p>
<p>Sombre forest rolled down to the water&#8217;s edge, and
he could see that there was already a broad ribbon of
frothy whiteness beneath it, while so far as he had noticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
that beach consisted of rock ledges and very large boulders.
It was about the last place he would have chosen to make
a landing on, in a light and fragile dinghy.</p>
<p>After that, he looked resolutely astern over his companion&#8217;s
shoulders as she swung up between him and
the sea with the slate-green ridges and tumbling white
tops of the combers behind her. At length a hazarded
glance showed him that they were close inshore, and he
wondered for a moment whether he could swing the dinghy
round without rolling the boat over. He did not think it
could be done, and set his lips as he let her go, careering
on a comber&#8217;s crest, with at least half her length out of
the water.</p>
<p>Then there was a white upheaval close alongside, and
for a moment a black mass of stone appeared amidst the
leaping foam. They swept by it, and he gasped with relief
as he looked at Miss Hamilton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get hold of me when she strikes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The dinghy swung round, twisting broadside-on with
the brine pouring into her in spite of all that he could
do; and while he tore at one oar, another white sea that
curled menacingly rose up astern. It broke right into the
boat, and in another moment there was a crash, and Nasmyth,
who let the oars drop, stretched out his arms to
the girl. He jumped when she clutched him, and found
himself standing amid the swirling froth on what seemed
to be a ledge of very slippery stone, with both arms about
her, while the crushed-in dinghy swept up among the
foam-lapped boulders. He sprang down from the stone
as another sea came in, and floundered ashore waist-deep
with it, after which he set his dripping companion down
upon the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re rather wet,&#8221; he said, when he got
his breath again. &#8220;Still, I really couldn&#8217;t help it. There
was a good deal more sea than I had expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Hamilton, who sat down on a boulder with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
water dripping from her skirt, looked ruefully at him and
the dinghy, which was rolling over in the surf.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are we going to get off?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in that dinghy, any way,&#8221; answered Nasmyth.
&#8220;She has knocked all one bilge in. They&#8217;ll probably
send the <i>Tillicum&#8217;s</i> gig ashore for us by-and-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s going away!&#8221; said the girl, with a gasp
of consternation.</p>
<p>Nasmyth, who turned round, saw that this was certainly
the case. A cloud of steam blew away from beside
the yacht&#8217;s funnel, and in another moment the shriek of
a whistle reached him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we need worry about that,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;They evidently watched us get ashore. You
see, with the breeze freshening she couldn&#8217;t very well lie
where she was. Still, if I remember, there&#8217;s an inlet a
couple of leagues or so away along the coast where she&#8217;d
find shelter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t they send for us first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that there is really a nasty sea, and
they couldn&#8217;t very well take us off if they knocked a big
hole in the gig. I fancy the wisest thing would be to
walk towards that inlet along the beach.&#8221;</p>
<p>They set off, when Nasmyth had pulled the dinghy
out, but the beach was strewn with driftwood which was
difficult to flounder over, as well as very rough. They
made no greater progress when they tried the Bush. Fallen
trees lay across one another, and there were thorny thickets
in between, while, here and there, the undergrowth seemed
as impenetrable as a wall. By-and-by it commenced to
rain, and for an hour or two they plodded on dejectedly
through the pitiless deluge. It rains exceedingly hard in
that country. At last the girl sat down on a fallen tree.
She had already lost her hat, and the water soaked out of
Nasmyth&#8217;s jacket, which he had tied by the arms about
her shoulders. Her drenched skirt clung about her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
rent to tatters, and one of her little shoes was caked
with mire. The other gaped open.</p>
<p>&#8220;How far have we gone?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;About a league,&#8221; answered Nasmyth quietly. &#8220;I
think we could make the inlet in another two hours.
That is, if the beach isn&#8217;t very much rougher.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl leaned against a branch wearily. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
I can&#8217;t go a step further,&#8221; she replied with trembling
lips.</p>
<p>The rain beat upon them, and Nasmyth stood still a
moment looking at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we really can&#8217;t stay here. Since
there seems no other way, I think I could carry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His diffidence was evident, and Violet smiled. &#8220;Have
you ever carried anybody&ndash;&ndash;a distance&ndash;&ndash;before?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;I certainly haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t think there would be much use in
trying. You couldn&#8217;t carry me for more than four or
five minutes. That wouldn&#8217;t be worth while, would it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said nothing for a minute or two, for he felt
compassionate as well as a trifle confused. He had, in
fact, already discovered that there are occasions when a
young woman is apt to show greater self-possession and
look facts in the face more plainly than a man. Then he
set to work furiously with a branch which he tore from
the fallen tree, ripping off rough slabs of bark, and in the
course of half an hour had constructed a shelter about
the base of a cedar. It, at least, kept the rain off when
Violet sat under it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be as well if I pushed on for the inlet and
brought George or Acton back with me,&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;We could make something to carry you in, if there was
too much sea for the gig.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flush crept into the girl&#8217;s face, and she looked at
him reproachfully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How could I stay here alone?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
say those foolish things. Come in out of the rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bark shelter would just hold the two of them,
and Nasmyth, dripping, sat down close beside her. She
looked very forlorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for you,&#8221; he said awkwardly.</p>
<p>The girl showed faint signs of temper. &#8220;You have
told me that before. Why don&#8217;t you do something?
You said you had lived in the Bush, and now you have
only been a few hours in it. It was seven o&#8217;clock when
we had breakfast. Can&#8217;t you even make a fire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t,&#8221; answered Nasmyth deprecatingly.
&#8220;You see, one has usually an axe and some matches, as
well as a few other odds and ends, when one lives in the
Bush. A man is a wretchedly helpless being when he
has only his hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact was borne in upon Violet forcibly as she
glanced out at the wet beach, tumbling sea, and dreary,
dripping Bush. The Bush rolled back, a long succession
of straggling pines that rose one behind the other in
sombre ranks, to the rugged hills that cut against the
hazy sky. There was, no doubt, all that man required
to provide him with warmth and food and shelter in
that forest, but it was certain that it was only by continuous
and arduous toil that he could render it available.
Indeed, since he could not make himself an axe or a
saw or a rifle, it was also evident that his efforts would
be fruitless unless backed by the toil of others who
played their part in the great scheme of human co-operation.</p>
<p>It is, however, probable that Violet did not concern
herself with this aspect of the matter, but she had led a
sheltered life, and it was curiously disconcerting to find
herself brought suddenly face to face with primitive realities.
She was wet through and worn out, and although
evening was not far away, she had eaten nothing since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
seven o&#8217;clock that morning. The momentary petulance
deserted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;they mayn&#8217;t be able to send off
for us for perhaps a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite likely that the breeze will drop at sunset,&#8221;
Nasmyth replied cheerfully. &#8220;These westerly breezes
often do. Anyway, the rain seems to be stopping, and I
may be able to dry my matches. In the meanwhile I
might come across something to eat. There are oysters
on some of these beaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet glanced at the Bush apprehensively, and once
more it was evident that she did not wish him to leave
her. This sent a little thrill of satisfaction through him,
and although he half-consciously contrasted her with
Laura Waynefleet, it was not altogether to her disadvantage.
It is a curious fact that some men, and probably
women, too, feel more drawn to the persons upon whom
they confer a benefit than to those from whom they receive
one. Laura Waynefleet, he realized, would have
urged him to make some attempt to reach the <i>Tillicum</i>,
and in all probability would have insisted on taking a
share in it, while his companion desired only to lean on
him. After all, Laura&#8217;s attitude was more pleasant to the
subconscious vanity that was in his nature, and in this respect
he probably differed but little from most of his
fellows.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be very long away?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth reassured her upon this point, and floundered
down to the beach, where he carefully laid out to dry
the little block of sulphur matches that he carried. Then
he crawled among the boulders near low-water mark,
and, since oysters are tolerably plentiful along those
beaches, succeeded in collecting several dozen of them.
After that he sat down and gazed seaward for a minute or
two. There was no sign of the <i>Tillicum</i>, only a strip of
dingy, slate-green sea smeared with streaks of froth, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
shone white beneath a heavy, lowering sky. Close in front
of him the sea hove itself up in rows of foam-crested
ridges, which fell upon the boulders and swirled over them
and among them a furious white seething. He fancied
that it was near sunset, and it was clear that the breeze
was a little lighter. It seemed to him just possible that
four capable seamen might keep the gig afloat close enough
to the beach for one to wade out to her, though there
would be a certain peril in such a proceeding. Still, there
were not four capable seamen on board the <i>Tillicum</i>!</p>
<p>Gathering up his matches, which had dried, Nasmyth
went back to the bark shelter. He was pleasantly conscious
of the relief in Miss Hamilton&#8217;s eyes when he
reached it, and fancied that she was too overwrought and
anxious to care whether he noticed it or not; but he set
about making a fire, and she helped him to collect brittle
undergrowth and fallen branches. Then they sat down
and ate the oysters that he had laid among the embers. He
thought they were not in season, and they were certainly
burnt and shrivelled, as well as somewhat gritty; but one
is glad to eat anything after a long day of exertion, and
Nasmyth watched his companion with quiet appreciation
as she handled the rough shells daintily with little delicate
fingers. Her evident reliance upon him had its effect.</p>
<p>He carried an armful of branches to the beach, and
started another fire where it could be seen from seawards,
after which he went back and sat outside the shelter near
Miss Hamilton, while darkness crept up from the eastwards
across the Bush. It grew dim and solemn, and the
doleful wailing of the pines was curiously impressive.
The girl shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind is very chilly,&#8221; she said, with a tremor in
her voice. &#8220;You will stay here where I can see you.
You won&#8217;t go away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to keep up the fire on the beach,&#8221; Nasmyth
answered reassuringly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>She crept into the shelter, and he could see her dimly
when the flickering light blazed up, but he could never
remember how many journeys he made to the fire upon
the beach before his eyes grew heavy as he sat amid the
whirling smoke. He endeavoured to keep awake, and
resolutely straightened himself once or twice, but at last
his eyes closed altogether, and he did not hear the shriek
of the <i>Tillicum&#8217;s</i> whistle ring far across the shadowy
Bush. Indeed, he did not waken when Acton and Wisbech
came floundering into the light of the fire; and the
two men looked at each other when they stopped beside
it and saw him lying there, and then discovered the girl
inside the shelter. Acton raised his hand warningly, while
a faint twinkle crept into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;s no reason why anybody else should
hear of this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It seems to me that Miss Hamilton
would be just as well pleased if we were not around
when she awakens.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stooped and shook Nasmyth&#8217;s shoulder as Wisbech
disappeared among the shadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; said Acton. &#8220;Wait until I get away, and
then waken her.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a minute before Nasmyth, who stood up stiffly,
quite understood him, and then the blood rose to his face
as he crept into the shelter and touched the girl. She
sprang to her feet with a little cry and clutched his arm.
Then she suddenly let her hand fall back, and her cheeks
flushed crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The steamer&#8217;s close by,&#8221; said Nasmyth reassuringly.
&#8220;They have sent for us at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went out together, and it was a minute or two
later when they came upon Wisbech and Acton in the
Bush. Nasmyth entered into confused explanations as
they proceeded towards the beach. The sky was a little
lighter when they reached it, and standing near the sinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
fire, they could dimly see the gig plunging amidst
the froth and spray. Then George&#8217;s voice reached them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you let us have them, Mr. Acton? It&#8217;s most
all we can do to keep her off the beach,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Acton glanced at the strip of tumbling foam&ndash;&ndash;through
which he had waded waist-deep&ndash;&ndash;between them and the
boat, and Nasmyth turned towards Miss Hamilton, who,
to his astonishment, recoiled from him. Acton, however,
made him a sign of command.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she&#8217;d be safer with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said nothing, but he picked the girl up, as
unconcernedly as he could, for the second time that day,
and staggered down the rough beach with her. He contrived
to keep his footing when a frothing sea broke
against him, and, floundering through the seething water,
reached the lurching boat. George seized his burden, and
gently deposited it in one of the seats. Scrambling on
board, Nasmyth groped for an oar, and in another minute
or two they laboriously drove the gig out towards the
blinking lights of the <i>Tillicum</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>TRANQUILLITY</h3>
</div>
<p>The afternoon was very hot when Nasmyth plodded
down a steep hillside through the thick red dust of
the waggon trail. A fire had swept the undergrowth
away, and there was no shade among the trees which,
stripped of their branches, towered about him, great
charred and blackened columns. Close ahead the primeval
Bush rose in an unbroken sombre mass, and Nasmyth,
who quickened his pace a trifle, sat down with a gasp of
satisfaction when he reached the first of the shadow. It
was fresh and cool there. The Bush was scented with
the odours of pine and cedar, and filled with the soft
murmur of falling water, while he knew that just beyond
it Bonavista stood above the sparkling sea.</p>
<p>He was on his way from the railroad dep&ocirc;t. It was
just a fortnight since he had left the <i>Tillicum</i> at the little
mining town, on the day after the one he and Violet
Hamilton had spent on the beach, and he had not seen
her before he went. Now he fancied that a welcome
awaited him, and he felt sincerely pleased to be
back again. As he sat beneath a great cedar filling his
pipe, it seemed to him only appropriate that he should
approach Bonavista through that belt of cool, sweet-scented
Bush. It made it easier to feel that he had left
behind him all that associated him with the strife and
bustle of the hot and noisy cities. At Bonavista were
leisure, comfort, and tranquillity, which were, after all,
things that made a strong appeal to one side of his nature,
and he had made no progress in the city. There was also
no doubt that both Mr. and Mrs. Acton were glad to
entertain him for a time. He sat still a few minutes, and
then went on slowly beneath the towering redwoods and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
cedars until he came out of the forest, and saw the sunlight
stream down on the shingled roof of Bonavista close
ahead.</p>
<p>The house appeared to be empty, and he had shed his
dusty city clothes in his room and had dressed again before
he came upon Mrs. Acton, sitting half asleep on a
secluded strip of veranda. She roused herself and smiled
when she saw him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have come back at last. We have been expecting
you all the past week,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; returned Nasmyth, &#8220;was remarkably good of
you. In fact, I have wondered now and then, with some
misgivings, whether you have not seen too much of me
already.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton laughed. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry yourself
on that point. We have all our little hobbies. My husband&#8217;s
is the acquisition of dollars and the opening of
mines and mills. Mine is the amusing of my friends, or,
rather, the permitting them to amuse themselves, which
is why I had Bonavista built. I make only one stipulation&ndash;&ndash;it
is that when you stay with us, you are amused.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a little sigh of content, Nasmyth settled himself
in a canvas chair, and glanced out between the slender
pillars of the cool veranda at the wall of dusky forest and
the flashing sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;can you doubt it, my dear lady?
After logging camp and mine and city, this is an enchanted
land. I think it is always summer afternoon at
Bonavista.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton smiled at him graciously. &#8220;That,&#8221; she
observed, &#8220;was quite nice of you. Things haven&#8217;t gone
just as you would have liked them to go, in the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t,&#8221; admitted Nasmyth whimsically. &#8220;As
a matter of fact, they very seldom do. Still, I wouldn&#8217;t
like you to think that was the only reason I am glad to
get back.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Acton&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;I imagine I am acquainted
with the other. You were rather tactful in
going away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went because Mr. Acton handed me a letter which
said that a business man in Victoria would like a talk
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case, Miss Hamilton seems to be under the
impression that it was nice of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice of me to go away?&#8221; and Nasmyth&#8217;s tone was
mildly reproachful.</p>
<p>&#8220;One would not resent a desire to save one any little
embarrassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; observed Nasmyth, with an air of reflection,
&#8220;the trouble is that I couldn&#8217;t contrive to keep out of
her sight continually even if I wanted to, and&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he lowered
his voice confidentially&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;as it happens, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know of any particular
reason why you should do that. Violet has probably quite
recovered her equanimity and decided on her attitude
towards you.&#8221; Then she changed the subject abruptly.
&#8220;I wonder if I may point out that there has been a
change in you, since my husband brought you here. For
one thing, you are much more amusing. Even your voice
is different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth bowed. &#8220;But not my hands,&#8221; he said; and
as he held up one hand, she noticed the scars on it and
the coarseness of his nails. &#8220;That tells a tale, I think.
My dear lady, I scarcely think you quite realize all that
you have given me. You have never seen how we lived in
the lonely logging camps&ndash;&ndash;packed like cattle in a reeking
shed&ndash;&ndash;and you do not know the grim side of our life in
the Bush. It would be no great use to tell you that I
have now and then limped for days together over the ballast
of a railroad track, wondering where my next dollar
was to come from. These are the things one could not
expect you to understand.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Acton&#8217;s face softened a little. &#8220;Still, I think
my husband does,&#8221; she replied. Then she smiled at him.
&#8220;It almost seems to me that you need never go back to
that life again unless you like it. I mean, of course, that,
for one thing, your uncle has his views concerning you.
He has to some extent taken Mr. Acton into his confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth made no comment, and Mrs. Acton sank
down a little further into her long chair. &#8220;The others are
down on the beach,&#8221; she announced drowsily. &#8220;I really
think I was going to sleep when you made your appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth could take a hint, and he strolled away down
the veranda stairway and around the edge of the wide
clearing in the shadow of the Bush, until he stood looking
down upon the sea from the crown of the bluff. Then
he felt a little thrill, for some twenty or thirty feet beneath
him was a patch of something white in the shadow
of the shrubbery. He went down quietly until he stopped,
and, stooping, touched Violet Hamilton&#8217;s shoulder. She
looked around with a start, and a faint trace of embarrassment
crept into her face at the sight of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I thought you were in Victoria.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth stretched himself out upon a ledge of rock
near her feet. &#8220;Mrs. Acton was good enough to imply
that she had been expecting me more or less anxiously for
several days,&#8221; he rejoined in a tone of reproach. &#8220;In
fact, she used the plural pronoun, which led me to believe
that somebody else must have shared her anxiety. She
did not, however, point out who it was that she meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her husband, in all probability. She could, at least,
speak for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth appeared to ponder over this, though his heart
was beating faster than usual, for the suggestion of confusion
which he had noticed in the girl&#8217;s manner had its
significance for him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he conceded, &#8220;it may have been Acton, but I
almost ventured to believe she meant somebody else. In
any case, I shouldn&#8217;t like to think you were displeased at
my reappearance. If you are, I can, of course, go away
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not the only person at Bonavista. Wouldn&#8217;t
anybody else&#8217;s wishes count&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Acton&#8217;s, for instance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; asserted Nasmyth reflectively. &#8220;At least, not
to anything like the same extent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet laughed. &#8220;The difficulty is that nobody can tell
how much you really mean. You are so seldom serious.&#8221;
She cast a quick glance at him. &#8220;You were not like that
when you first came here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;you can blame it on Bonavista.
As I have been trying to explain to Mrs. Acton,
who made a similar observation, there is glamour in this
air. It gets hold of one. I was, no doubt, a tediously
solemn person when I left the Bush, but you will remember
that soon after I arrived here, you and I sailed out
together into the realms of moonlight and mystery. I
sometimes feel that I must have brought a little of the
latter back with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet said nothing for half a minute, during which
she lay resting on one elbow, looking down upon the
cool, green flashing of the water a hundred feet below,
and again Nasmyth felt a little thrill run through him.
She was so very dainty in speech and thought and person,
a woman of the world he had once belonged to, and
which it now seemed he might enter again. Her delicately
chiselled, half-averted face matched the slight but
finely moulded figure about which the thin white draperies
clung. She turned and looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly can&#8217;t be serious now,&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you that when I mentioned the glamour
and mystery, I was never half so serious in my life. They
are, after all, very real things.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>He was, as a matter of fact, grimly serious for the
moment as he wondered at the change that had come over
him. His life in the silent Bush, the struggle with the
icy river, and even Laura Waynefleet, who had encouraged
him in his work of rehabilitation, had by degrees
become no more than a dim, blurred memory. He knew
that he could recall it all, but he had no wish to make
the effort, for it was more pleasant to hear the sighing
of the summer wind about the firs of Bonavista, and
wonder languidly what his companion thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t thanked you for taking care of me the
day we were left behind on the beach,&#8221; said Violet.</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a sign of protest. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
you are under any very great obligation to me. As a
matter of fact, my efforts on your behalf nearly resulted
in my drowning you. Besides, you see, there was really
not the slightest cause for uneasiness. Acton certainly
would have sent for us when the wind dropped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it might have blown for days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Nasmyth, with a twinkle in his eyes,
&#8220;we would have lived on salmon and berries until it
stopped. One really can live on them for a considerable
time, though they are not remarkably palatable when one
has anything else to eat; in fact, it&#8217;s a thing I&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salmon is not esteemed in that country, except for the
purpose of sending East in cans, and it is seldom that
anybody eats it except the Indians. There is probably no
diet that more rapidly grows satiating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; exclaimed the girl, with a shiver, &#8220;it would
have been horrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was evidently not thinking of the salmon, but of
the dreary, dripping Bush, and Nasmyth looked at her
with reproach in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t think it would have been,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;In fact, I believe we could have lived there for a little
while very contentedly&ndash;&ndash;that is, when I had fixed things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
up a bit. After all, there is a certain glamour in the
Bush when one gets used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw the faint colour creep into her face, and, though
it cost him an effort, laid a restraint upon himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I at least would not have felt that
I had any cause to complain, though, no doubt, it would
have been different with you. You see&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and he made
an expressive gesture&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I have had a long tough tussle
since I came to Canada, and experiences of that sort have
their effect on one. In fact, they set one apart from
those who haven&#8217;t undergone them. It seems to have
struck you that I was prematurely solemn and serious
when I came to Bonavista.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought he saw sympathy in Violet Hamilton&#8217;s
eyes, and her next observation made it clear that her
mind was busy with the suggestion that he had conveyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;you cannot be very much
older than I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four years, perhaps,&#8221; returned Nasmyth, with a trace
of grimness. &#8220;That is, in one sense. In another, I think
I am double your age. You see, you have never been
brought into contact with the realities of life. If you
had been, you would probably not be so ready to take me
for what you think I am, as I believe you have graciously
done. After all, you know so very little about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt that he was doing no more than discharging
an obligation in giving her this warning. He desired to
afford her every opportunity of satisfying herself concerning
him, for he was not a fool, and he had seen for a
moment or two a suggestive softness in her face. It is
possible that she did not know it had been there, but he
felt that if he roused himself and made the effort, he
might sweep away the barriers between them.</p>
<p>Violet appeared troubled by his words. She sat silent,
while Nasmyth wondered what she would say. He was
aware that a good deal depended upon her next remark.
Then there were footsteps on the slope behind them, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
turning suddenly, he saw Acton and another man approaching
them. He rose with a little start when he
recognized the second man as Gordon, who was neatly
attired in city clothes. Gordon looked down at Nasmyth
with a faint sardonic smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gordon turned up half an hour ago,&#8221; Acton said.
&#8220;It appears that he was going into the city, and got off
the cars to talk over things with you. I believe he had
a notion of going on again to-night, but Mrs. Acton won&#8217;t
hear of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon bowed in the direction of his host.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have put up a more vigorous protest against
troubling Mrs. Acton than I did, if I had felt it would
have been of any use,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Acton, smiling, &#8220;I guess they&#8217;ll be
getting supper ready, and we were sent here to bring our
friend and Miss Hamilton in.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went back to the house together, where they
found the long table spread. It was characteristic of the
owner of Bonavista that he still called the evening meal
supper. There were, besides Nasmyth and Wisbech, five
or six other guests from Victoria and one of the rising
cities on Puget Sound, and Gordon speedily made himself
very much at home. Most of his new acquaintances
found what he had to say entertaining, but Miss Hamilton
was, as Nasmyth noticed, somewhat silent. Nasmyth,
on his part, felt slightly restless, for his old comrade&#8217;s
presence had an unsettling effect on him. It was, however,
not until an hour or two later that he and Gordon
were able to discuss their own affairs. They sat on the
veranda looking down upon the sea, while the dusk slowly
crept up from the east.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;I should like to hear what
you have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s not a great deal,&#8221; replied Nasmyth.
&#8220;The Crown land authorities appear disposed to sell the
land instead of leasing it, which of late has been the more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
usual course; but they insist on counting a certain proportion
of the hillside and big timber in. I may get one
or two concessions, and I&#8217;m still keeping the affair before
them. In the meanwhile I&#8217;ve been seeing what can be
done to raise enough capital to take up all the land, but
haven&#8217;t met with any great success. The folks I&#8217;ve been
in communication with, as usual, want all the profit; in
fact, I almost fancy it might be as well to raise what
money we can around the settlement, and content ourselves
with locating a portion of the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon nodded. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do much about the fall
until after the autumn freshets, anyway, and there&#8217;s a
good deal you can&#8217;t get at until the frost sets in,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;In the meanwhile the offers Wheeler and I
made you hold.&#8221;</p>
<p>They discussed the matter until Mrs. Acton appeared
on the veranda and shook her head at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you two doing here when there are pretty
girls in the house waiting for a dance?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we have been very remiss,&#8221; apologized
Nasmyth, when they joined her. &#8220;Still, we didn&#8217;t know,
and we had some business to talk about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be plenty of time for that to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that I shall be in the city then,&#8221; said
Gordon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton laughed. &#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she contradicted.
&#8220;We are all going for a sail on the straits to-morrow,
and we certainly expect you to join us. In the meanwhile,
I believe there are two young women waiting for partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>She silenced Gordon&#8217;s objections as they turned back
towards the house. They found the dancing had commenced,
and Nasmyth failed to secure Miss Hamilton as
a partner for any time in the evening. He could not help
a fancy that she had taken some little trouble to bring
about this result.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>NASMYTH HEARS THE RIVER</h3>
</div>
<p>Darkness had settled down on Bonavista next evening
when Nasmyth lay in a canvas chair on the veranda,
while Gordon leaned against the balustrade in
front of him with a cigar in his hand. A blaze of light
streamed out from one of the long open windows a few
yards away, and somebody was singing in the room behind
it, while the splash of the gentle surf came up from
the foot of the promontory in a deep monotone. Now
and then a shadowy figure strolled into the veranda or
crossed it to the terrace below, but for the time being
nobody disturbed the two men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a word with you since last night,&#8221; said
Nasmyth. &#8220;How are the boys at the settlement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hustling along as usual.&#8221; Gordon laughed. &#8220;Is
there anybody else you feel inclined to ask about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;there certainly is. How is
Miss Waynefleet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon looked down at his cigar. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m a little worried on her account. She was attempting
to do a great deal more than was good for her when
I last saw her. They have no longer a hired man at the
ranch. Waynefleet, I understand, is rather tightly fixed
for money, and, as you know, he isn&#8217;t the kind of man
who would deny himself. He was talking of selling
some stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth suddenly straightened himself, and closed one
hand rather hard on the arm of his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What right have you and I to be lounging here when
that girl is working late and early on the ranch?&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
asked. &#8220;Gordon, you will have to buy two or three
head of that stock at double value for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a big question;&#8221; and Gordon&#8217;s tone was
serious. &#8220;In fact, I fancy it&#8217;s one that neither you nor
I can throw much light upon. Anyway, I may as well
point out that I arrived here only yesterday, and I&#8217;m
going on again in the morning. As to the other matter,
Laura Waynefleet has friends who will stand by her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you count me one of them?&#8221; Nasmyth demanded.
&#8220;That girl saved my life for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon glanced round sharply, for there were light
footsteps on the veranda, and he almost imagined that a
white figure in filmy draperies stopped a moment. It,
however, went on again and vanished in the shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she did,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;Well, if there&#8217;s
anything that can be done, you may rely on me.&#8221; He
made an abrupt gesture, and as he turned, the light from
the window fell upon his face, showing the curious smile
on it. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung the question at his comrade, and Nasmyth,
who knew what he meant, sat for a moment or two with
wrinkled forehead. There was no reason why he should
not stay there so long as Mr. and Mrs. Acton desired
his company, but it did not seem fitting that he should
spend those summer days in luxurious idleness while Laura
Waynefleet toiled late and early at the lonely ranch.
Again, he seemed to see her steady eyes with the quiet
courage in them, and the gleam of her red-gold hair.
Even then she was, he reflected, in all probability occupied
with some severe drudgery. It was a thing he did
not like to contemplate, and he almost resented the fact
that Gordon should have brought such thoughts into his
mind. His comrade had broken in upon his contentment
like a frosty wind that stung him to action. Still, he answered
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am within easy reach of the city here,&#8221; he explained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
&#8220;Acton, who has once or twice given me good advice, is
acquainted with most of the folks likely to be of any use
to us, and has laid the scheme before one or two of them.
That, at least, is one reason why I am staying at Bonavista.
It&#8217;s perfectly evident that it wouldn&#8217;t be any benefit
to Miss Waynefleet if I went back to the Bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Gordon grimly; &#8220;if you were likely to
be of any use or consolation to her, you&#8217;d go, if I had to
drag you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. He was too well acquainted with
his comrade&#8217;s manner to take offence at this remark, and
the man&#8217;s devotion to the girl who, he knew, would never
regard him as more than a friend also had its effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since plain speaking seems admissible,
you are probably aware that Laura Waynefleet has
nothing beyond a kindly interest in me. She is, I needn&#8217;t
point out, a remarkably sensible young lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped somewhat abruptly, for Wisbech emerged
from the shadows beneath the pillars, and sat down in a
chair close by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Wisbech, &#8220;I heard, and it seems to me
Derrick&#8217;s right in one respect. Though I don&#8217;t know
how far it accounts for the other fact he has just impressed
on you, Miss Waynefleet certainly possesses a
considerable amount of sense. She is also a young lady
I have a high opinion of. Still, if he had gone back to
the Bush merely because you insisted on it, I think I
should have cast him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon appeared to ponder over this, and he then
laughed softly. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite natural, and I guess I sympathize
with you,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;In one way, however,
your nephew&#8217;s acquitting himself creditably, considering
that there are apparently three people anxious to
exert a beneficent influence upon him. The effect of that
kind of thing is apt to become a trifle bewildering, especially
as it&#8217;s evident their views can&#8217;t invariably coincide.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Three?&#8221; said Wisbech, with a twinkle in his eyes.
&#8220;If you count me in, I almost fancy there are four.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said nothing, though he felt his face grow
hot. Gordon smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;I had a notion
that Miss Hamilton resented my being here. Any way,
she didn&#8217;t take any very noticeable trouble to be pleasant
to me to-day. No doubt she considers any influence she
may choose to exert should be quite sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;That is, to any man
who happened to be a judge of character, and had eyes
in his head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon waved one hand. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he averred, &#8220;she&#8217;s
very dainty, and I think there&#8217;s a little more than prettiness
there, which is a very liberal admission, since I&#8217;m
troubled with an impression that she isn&#8217;t quite pleased
with me. Still, when the woods are full of pretty girls,
I guess it&#8217;s wisest of a man who has anything worth while
to do in front of him to keep his eyes right on the trail,
and go steadily ahead.&#8221; He turned to Wisbech deprecatingly.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t mind you, sir. We regard you as
part of the concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Wisbech, with a certain dryness. &#8220;I
believe I am interested in it&ndash;&ndash;at least, financially.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;when I break loose, as I do
now and then, I quite often say a little more than is
strictly advisable without meaning to. It&#8217;s a habit some
folks have. Your observation, however, switches us off
on to a different matter. I&#8217;ve been telling your nephew
we leave him to handle the thing and stand by our offers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is precisely what I mean to do. The affair is
Derrick&#8217;s. He must take his own course,&#8221; declared Wisbech.</p>
<p>Gordon grinned as he turned to Nasmyth. &#8220;There
will be no reinforcements. You have to win your spurs.&#8221;
Then he looked at Wisbech. &#8220;If you will not be offended,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
sir, I would like to say I&#8217;m pleased to notice that
your ideas coincide with mine. He&#8217;ll be the tougher
afterwards if you let him put up his fight alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The assurance is naturally satisfactory,&#8221; said Wisbech
with quiet amusement. Then he held up one hand.
&#8220;It seems to me the person at the piano is playing exceptionally
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat silent while the crashing opening chords rang
out from the lighted room, and then Nasmyth, who was
a lover of music, found himself listening with a strained
attention as the theme stole out of them, for it chimed
with his mood. He had been restless and disturbed in
mind before Gordon had flung his veiled hints at him,
and the reality underlying his comrade&#8217;s badinage had a
further unsettling effect. He did not know what the
music was, but it seemed in keeping with the throb of
the sea against the crag and the fitful wailing of the
pines. There was a suggestion of effort and struggle in
it, and, it seemed to him, something that spoke of a great
dominant force steadily pressing on; and, as he listened,
the splash of the sea grew fainter, and he heard instead
the roar of the icy flood and the crash of mighty trees
driving down upon his half-built dam. These were sounds
which sometimes haunted him against his will, and once
or twice he had been a little surprised to find that, now
that they were past, he could look back upon the months
of tense effort with a curious, half-regretful pleasure. He
was relieved when the music, that swelled in a sonorous
crescendo, stopped, and he saw Gordon glance at Wisbech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that man has understanding and the gift of
expressing what he feels,&#8221; said Wisbech. &#8220;The music
suggested something to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fast freight,&#8221; confessed Gordon.&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;When she&#8217;s
coming down the big ca&ntilde;on under a full head of steam.
I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s quite an elegant simile, in one way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Still, if you care to think how that track was built, it&#8217;s
not difficult to fancy there&#8217;s triumph in the whistles and
the roar of the freight-car wheels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech made a sign of comprehension, and Gordon
looked hard at Nasmyth. &#8220;It&#8217;s your call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the river,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;In fact, I often
hear it, and now and then wish I didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s unsettling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon laughed in a suggestive fashion. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
declared, &#8220;most of us hear something of that kind at
times, and no doubt it&#8217;s just as well we do. It&#8217;s apt to
have results if you listen. You have been most of a month
in the city one way or another. You took to it kindly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Nasmyth answered, and it was evident
that he was serious. &#8220;I came back here feeling that I
had had quite enough of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bonavista is a good deal more pleasant?&#8221; And there
was a certain meaning in Gordon&#8217;s tone. &#8220;You seemed
to have achieved some social success here, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw the flush in Nasmyth&#8217;s face, and his gaze grew
insistent. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re not going to let that
content you, now you can hear the river. You&#8217;ll hear
it more and more plainly frothing in the black ca&ntilde;on
where the big trees come down. You have lived with the
exiles, and the wilderness has got its grip on you. What&#8217;s
more, I guess when it does that it never quite lets go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly, and just then Acton stepped
out from the window. &#8220;Mr. Gordon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s my
wife&#8217;s wish that you should come in and sing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon said that he was in Mrs. Acton&#8217;s hands, and
then turned to Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had my say,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;If there&#8217;s any
meaning in my remarks, you can worry it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went away with Acton, and Wisbech looked at his
nephew over his cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gordon expresses himself in a rather extravagant
fashion, but I&#8217;m disposed to fancy there is something
in what he says,&#8221; he commented.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth did not answer him. He was, on the whole,
glad that Gordon had gone, but he still seemed to hear
the river, and the restlessness that had troubled him was
becoming stronger. He retired somewhat early, but he
did not sleep quite so soundly as usual that night. As it
happened, Gordon rose before him next morning. Gordon
went out of doors, and presently came upon Miss
Hamilton, who was strolling bareheaded where the early
sunshine streamed in among the pines. It struck him
that he was not the person whom she would have been
most pleased to see, but she walked with him to the
crown of the promontory, where she stopped and looked
up at him steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gordon,&#8221; she inquired, &#8220;what is Laura Waynefleet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon started, and the girl smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I crossed the veranda last night,&#8221; she told him, when
he hesitated before answering her.</p>
<p>The man looked down on her with an unusual gravity.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said simply, &#8220;Laura Waynefleet is quietness,
and sweetness, and courage. In fact, I sometimes
think it was to make these things evident that she was
sent into this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought he saw a gleam of comprehension in the
girl&#8217;s eyes, and made a gesture of protest. &#8220;No,&#8221; he
assured her, &#8220;I&#8217;m not fit to brush her little shoes. For
that matter, though he is my comrade, Nasmyth isn&#8217;t
either. What is perhaps more to the purpose, I guess he
is quite aware of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A delicate tinge of colour crept into Violet Hamilton&#8217;s
face, and the man realized that in case his suppositions
were correct, what he had implied could hardly be considered
as a compliment. He could also fancy that there
was a certain uneasiness in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;perhaps it is a subject I should not
have ventured to inquire into.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon smiled reassuringly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know of any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
reason why you shouldn&#8217;t have done so, but I have
scarcely told you anything about her yet. Miss Waynefleet
lives at a desolate ranch in the Bush. Sometimes
she drives oxen, and I believe she invariably makes her
own clothes. I don&#8217;t think Nasmyth would feel any
great diffidence in speaking about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believed this, or at least he strove to convince himself
that he did, but he was relieved when the appearance
of Acton, who strolled towards them, rendered any further
confidential conversation out of the question. Gordon
set out for Victoria that afternoon, and Nasmyth,
who went with him to the railroad, returned to Bonavista
in a restless mood, and almost disposed to be angry
with his comrade for having rudely broken in upon his
tranquillity. In fact, he felt disinclined to face his
fellow-guests, which was one reason why he was sauntering
towards the inlet when he came upon Wisbech
sitting with a book in the shadow of the pines. Wisbech
looked up at his moody face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are annoyed because Gordon wouldn&#8217;t stay?&#8221;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;In fact, I&#8217;m a little relieved
that he has gone away. I naturally like Gordon, but just
now he has an unsettling effect on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech made a gesture of comprehension. &#8220;That
man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is in some respects fortunate. He has a
simple programme, and is evidently more or less content
with it. His work is plain in front of him. You are
not quite sure about yours yet. To some extent, you
feel yourself adrift?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have felt something of the kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech thought for a moment. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;it hasn&#8217;t occurred to you that your classical features&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re
Nasmyth features&ndash;&ndash;might be of some assistance to
you in your career?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt the blood rise into his face, but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
laughed. &#8220;They certainly haven&#8217;t proved of any great
benefit to me hitherto. It is scarcely likely that they will
do so either in the ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are still determined on directing operations
in person? I was commencing to wonder if you had any
reason for modifying your plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s tone was dry, but Nasmyth met his gaze,
which was now inquisitive.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is in my power to do it, I shall certainly run
the water out of the valley,&#8221; said Nasmyth.</p>
<p>Then he swung round and strolled away, while Wisbech
smiled in a fashion which suggested that he was
pleased. It was some little time later when Nasmyth,
pacing moodily over the white shingle beside the winding
inlet, came upon Violet Hamilton sitting in the shadow
of a great boulder. The girl&#8217;s light dress matched the
rock&#8217;s pale tinting, and he did not see her until he was
within a yard or two of her. He stopped abruptly, with a
deepened colour in his face. Violet made a sign, which
seemed to invite him to sit down, and he stretched himself
out upon the shingle close in front of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very hot in the house this afternoon, but it is
cool and quiet here,&#8221; she observed.</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced at the still water and the shadow
that the pines which clung in the crevices flung athwart
the dark rock&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stillness sometimes means stagnation. Miss Hamilton,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>The girl flashed a quick glance at him. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she
rejoined, &#8220;I suppose it does; but, after all, that is a question
we need not discuss. What were you thinking of
so hard as you came along? You didn&#8217;t see me until
you almost stepped upon my dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Nasmyth, with a laugh, &#8220;is proof that
I was thinking very hard indeed. It&#8217;s not a thing I often
indulge in, but I was thinking of the Bush.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You sometimes feel you would like to be back there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth reflectively; &#8220;I suppose I
ought to feel that, but I&#8217;m not sure that I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Violet remarked, &#8220;you have told me a good
deal at one time or another about your life and friends
there, but I almost fancied now and then that you were
keeping something back. After all&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and she smiled at
him&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I suppose that would have been only natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth raised himself on one elbow, and looked hard
at her. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;there was one thing I
did not tell you, though I had meant to do so sooner or
later. You see, there was nothing to warrant it in the
meanwhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; queried the girl, &#8220;it concerns Miss Waynefleet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s face grew suddenly grave. He did not ask
himself how she came to know. Indeed, for the time
being, that did not seem to matter. There was, it seemed,
only one course open to him, and he adopted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I will tell you about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had meant to be brief and matter-of-fact in his
narrative, but as he proceeded, the subject carried him
away. Indeed, he was scarcely conscious that Miss Hamilton
was intently watching him, for once more he seemed
to feel Laura Waynefleet&#8217;s eyes fixed upon his face, and
they were clear and brave and still. He spoke with a
certain dramatic force, and it was a somewhat striking
picture he drew of the girl. Violet could realize her personality
and the self-denying life that she led. It is possible
that Nasmyth had told her more than he intended,
when he broke off for a moment with a startling abruptness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she saved my life,&#8221; he added. &#8220;She certainly
gave me back my courage, and set me on my feet
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet looked at him with a strained expression in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
eyes. &#8220;And because of that she will have a hold upon
you while you live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth seemed to consider this. &#8220;I think I shall
always realize what I owe to her. Still&ndash;&ndash;and how shall
I say it?&ndash;&ndash;that recognition is the most I would venture
to offer, or that she would accept from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment, and then went on a trifle
hastily. &#8220;Laura Waynefleet could never have taken more
than a half-compassionate interest in me,&#8221; he asserted.
&#8220;There could scarcely be any doubt upon that point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said half-compassionate?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Nasmyth; &#8220;I almost think that describes
it. You see, I am naturally aware of my own disabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; persisted Violet, &#8220;she nursed you when you
were very ill, and, as you said, set you on your feet again.
That would probably count for a good deal with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a hasty gesture. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand.
She would no doubt have taken pity on any dumb
creature. She did it because she could not help it. One
could fancy that kind of thing was born in her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet did not speak for a moment or two. Although
it still remained uncertain whether the girl in the Bush
had any tenderness for the man she had set upon his feet
again, he had spoken of her in a manner which did not
quite please Violet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she ventured, with a little diffident glance at
him, &#8220;some day you will go back into the Bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think that&#8217;s
certain. In fact, it&#8217;s probable that I shall go back very
soon. As it happens, I have undertaken a big and rather
difficult thing, which will give me a considerable lift up
if I am successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lay silent for a minute before he turned to her
again. &#8220;You see, I have been some time in this country,
and never have done anything worth mentioning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Chopping trees and driving cattle are no doubt useful
occupations, but they don&#8217;t lead to anything. I feel that I
am, so to speak, on my probation. I have still to win
my spurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if that is one of the ideas Miss Waynefleet
gave you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. &#8220;I really believe it originated with
her, but, as a matter of fact, it might have gone no further,
which is an admission. Still, the desire to win those
spurs has been growing so strong of late that I can&#8217;t resist
it. In one way, I scarcely think that is very astonishing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet looked away from him, for she saw the gleam
in his eyes, and fancied she understood what the new
motive he had hinted at might be. Still, he did not
appear disposed to mention it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you would have to go away?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>A flush crept into Nasmyth&#8217;s face. She was a woman
of his own caste, and probably without intending it, she
had shown him in many ways that she was not averse
from him. He felt his heart beat fast when for a moment
she met his gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that if I do not go I shall never have
the right to come back again,&#8221; he told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; replied the girl very softly, &#8220;you wish to
come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why I am going. There are those spurs to
win. I have to make my mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is sometimes a little difficult to make one&#8217;s
mark, isn&#8217;t it? You may be ever so long, and it must be
a little hazardous in that horrible ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it gives me the right to come back, I think it will
be very well worth while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose you don&#8217;t succeed, after all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; admitted Nasmyth, &#8220;is a thing I daren&#8217;t contemplate,
because, if it happened, it is scarcely likely that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
any of my friends at Bonavista would ever be troubled
with me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet looked away from him. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you think that would be a little hard on them? Is it
very easy for you to go away?&#8221;</p>
<p>The restraint Nasmyth had imposed upon himself suddenly
deserted him. He moved a little nearer to her, and
seized one of her hands. She sat still, and made no effort
to draw it away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never meant to say what I am going to say
just now,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I had meant to wait until there
was something successfully accomplished to my credit.
I am, you see, a thriftless, wandering adventurer&ndash;&ndash;one
who has taken things as they came, and never has been
serious. When I have shown that I can also be something
else, I shall ask you formally if you will marry me.
Until then the thing is, of course, out of the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment, and held her silent by a
gesture until he went on again. &#8220;I have been swept
away, and even if you were willing to make it, I would
take no promise from you. Until I have won the right to
come back you must be absolutely free. Now you know
this, it would be very much wiser if I went away as soon
as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; the girl answered with a thrill in her voice,
&#8220;whenever you come back you will find me ready to
listen to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth let her hand go. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he asserted, &#8220;I
think I cannot fail. Still, it must be remembered that
you are absolutely free.&#8221;</p>
<p>He would have said something more, but there was
just then a laugh and a patter of feet on the path above,
and, looking up, he saw two of Mrs. Acton&#8217;s guests descending
the bluff.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>NASMYTH GOES AWAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Acton was sitting on the veranda next morning
when Nasmyth, fresh from a swim in the deep
cold water of the inlet, came up across the clearing. It
had brought a clear glow into his bronzed skin and a
brightness to his eyes, and as he flung a word to a man
who greeted him, his laugh had a clean, wholesome ring.
He walked straight toward the veranda, and Mrs. Acton,
sitting still, favoured him with a very keen and careful
scrutiny. He was dressed in light flannels, which, she
admitted, became him rather well; but it was the lithe
gracefulness of his movements that she noticed most. His
easy, half-whimsical manner had their effect on her; they
won her favour. He was the kind of guest she had pleasure
in welcoming at Bonavista.</p>
<p>He went up the veranda stairway, and, stopping near
where she was sitting, looked down at her with a curious
little glow in his eyes. She started, for she had not expected
to see it there so soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem unusually satisfied with everything this
morning,&#8221; she observed. &#8220;There is probably some cause
for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed. &#8220;I believe I am. As I dare say you
have noticed, tranquil contentment is one of my virtues.
It is, however, one that is remarkably easy to exercise at
Bonavista.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, contentment does not, as a rule, carry a young
man very far in this country. In fact, it is now and then
a little difficult to distinguish between it and something
else that is less creditable to the man who possesses it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth smiled good-humouredly. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;I have discovered that if you worry Fortune too
much she resents it, and flies away from you. It seems
to me there is something to be said for the quietly expectant
attitude. After all, one is now and then given
much more than one could by any effort possibly deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton noticed the faint ring in his voice. &#8220;Ah,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;then something of that kind has befallen you?
Hadn&#8217;t you better come to the point?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth became grave. &#8220;Madam,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have
a confession to make. I am very much afraid I lost my
head yesterday, and I should not be astonished if you
were very angry with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with a certain diffidence, and Mrs. Acton,
who straightened herself in her chair, watched him
steadily while he made his confession. He paused with a
gesture of deprecation.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one sense, it is a preposterous folly, but I am
not quite sure that folly is not now and then better
than wisdom,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It has certainly proved to
be so in my case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt.&#8221; Mrs. Acton&#8217;s tone was suggestive. &#8220;It
is, however, Miss Hamilton I am most interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth spread one hand out forcibly. &#8220;I want you
to understand that she is absolutely free. I have only
told you because you once mentioned that you considered
her a ward of yours. Nothing will be said to anybody
else, and, if she should change her mind, I will not complain.
In fact, I have decided that it would be most
fitting for me to go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; asserted Mrs. Acton, &#8220;you have been either
too generous or not quite generous enough. The trouble
with men of your kind is that when for once they take
the trouble to reflect, they become too cautious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t quite grasp the point of that.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You should either have said nothing, which is the
course you ought to have adopted, or a little more. I
fancy Violet would have been just as pleased if you had
shown yourself determined to make sure of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth stood silent, and Mrs. Acton, who surveyed
him again with thoughtful eyes, was not surprised that
he should have appealed to the girl&#8217;s imagination. The
man was of a fine lean symmetry, and straight of limb.
The stamp of a clean life was on him, showing itself in
the brightness of his eyes and his clear bronzed skin, while
he had, as Wisbech had said, the classical Nasmyth features.
These things, as Mrs. Acton admitted, counted
for something, while the faint lines upon his face, and
the suggestive hardness that now and then crept into it,
were, she decided, likely to excite a young woman&#8217;s curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I feel myself considerably to
blame, and I may admit that I had at first intended to
make my husband get rid of you. I really don&#8217;t know
why I didn&#8217;t. You can make what you like of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth bowed with a deferential smile, and she
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you must go away. Violet must
be free to change her mind, and, after all, it&#8217;s consoling
to reflect that she has not seen so very much of you yet.
In one way, it would please me if she did. It would
free me of a rather heavy responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped a moment, and looked at him with softening
eyes. &#8220;Go and run the water out of that valley,
or do anything else that will make a mark,&#8221; she advised.</p>
<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s face was set as he replied: &#8220;If the thing
is in any way possible, it shall be done. I think I will
go into Victoria again to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away and left her, and it was an hour later
when she came upon Violet sitting alone in a shady
walk beneath the pines. She looked at the girl severely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If I had been quite sure of what was going on, I
should have sent that young man away,&#8221; she remarked.
&#8220;As it is, I am very glad that he is going to Victoria.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet slipped an arm about Mrs. Acton&#8217;s neck and
kissed her shyly. &#8220;You would never have been so cruel,
and now you are going to be my friend,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want him to go back to that horrible ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton smiled. &#8220;I almost feel that I could shake
both of you, but I suppose I shall have to marshal my
forces on your behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p>She set about her plans that evening, when she invaded
Acton&#8217;s smoking-room, and her husband listened to her
with a little dry smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess this is about the first time I have ever known
you to do a real foolish thing,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Acton, &#8220;it is, perhaps, to my credit
that I have done one now. Anyway, I like the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton nodded. &#8220;Oh, yes;&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;that&#8217;s quite
comprehensible. There&#8217;s a good deal of tone about him,
but except with women that&#8217;s not a thing that counts in
this country. It&#8217;s the bulldog grip and grit that goes
farthest here&ndash;&ndash;anyway, when a man has no money behind
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t consider Nasmyth a weak man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in one way. When he&#8217;s right up against it, he&#8217;ll
stiffen himself and fight, but when the strain slackens a
little his kind are apt to let go too easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, as a matter of fact, was more or less correct, but
Mrs. Acton&#8217;s intention was not to discuss Nasmyth&#8217;s character,
and she smiled at her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she announced; &#8220;I expect you to take a hand
in the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton&#8217;s gesture was expressive of resignation. &#8220;I
guessed it. However, it seems to me that young man has
quite enough friends to give him a shove here and there
already. To begin with, there&#8217;s Wisbech.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What would Wisbech do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much.&#8221; And Acton smiled understandingly.
&#8220;He means to let his nephew feel his own feet. He&#8217;s a
sensible man. Then there&#8217;s that man Gordon from the
Bush, and it seems I&#8217;m to do my share, too. Guess if I
was Nasmyth, I&#8217;d say &#8216;thank you,&#8217; and go right ahead
without listening to one among the crowd of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; Mrs. Acton said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t quite the question. I
think I pointed out what I expect from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;You did,&#8221; he assured her.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to set things in train the first time I go down
to the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was somewhat vague, but Mrs. Acton was satisfied.
Nevertheless, she said nothing to Nasmyth on the
subject, and next afternoon he left Bonavista for Victoria.
A day or two later he called by appointment at
the office of a certain land exploitation agency, and found
Hutton waiting for him. Hutton, who sat with his elbows
on the table, pointed to a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have taken my view of the thing?&#8221; he said in
a questioning tone. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll sit down a minute, I&#8217;ll call
my clerk in, and he&#8217;ll get the papers ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need trouble to
do that just yet. You see, I haven&#8217;t the least intention
of closing with your offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is just possible that Hutton had expected this, but,
in any case, he betrayed no astonishment. He leaned
forward, regarding his visitor with an almost expressionless
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;I&#8217;ll hear your proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of the one I had the pleasure of
making you some time ago?&#8221; Nasmyth inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite out of the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled. &#8220;That,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;is in one
sense a pity, as I couldn&#8217;t repeat it to-day. If we are to
do business together, I should have to ask you for a considerably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
larger share of the profit. In fact, I was wondering
if you could see your way to offer half as much
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hutton gazed at him with sardonic amusement. &#8220;Oh,&#8221;
he replied, &#8220;has somebody left you a fortune, or are they
going to run a railroad through that valley?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth sat silent a moment or two, and it happened
that his easy indifference served him tolerably well. Had
he been a keener man, the anxiety to get about his work
in the ca&ntilde;on, of which he was certainly sensible, might
have led to his undoing; but he was not one who often
erred through undue precipitancy. The waiting fight
was, perhaps, the one for which he was particularly
adapted. If anything, he was rather too much addicted
to holding out his hand, and he realized that it behooves
the man without capital to be particularly wary in his negotiations
with the one in possession of money. His
recent interview with Violet Hamilton also had a stirring
effect on him, and now he sat quietly prepared to hold
his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;there has been no particular
change in my affairs. I have only been thinking things
over, and it seems to me I ought to get the terms I mentioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you had better try. It won&#8217;t be from any of
the accredited land agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth noticed the faint ring in his companion&#8217;s
voice. This, it seemed to him, was not bluff. The man,
he believed, meant what he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem quite sure of it,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Hutton was, but he felt annoyed
with himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I naturally know what they would
think of any proposition like the one you made me. Anyway,
as I suggested, all you have to do is to try them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Nasmyth, conscious that his companion was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
unobtrusively watching him, sat silent a moment or two. He
knew that if he broke with Hutton he might have considerable
difficulty in raising the money he required from any
corporation interested in such matters in that city; but he
had also another plan in his mind. He was far from
sure that the scheme would prove successful, and it was
at least certain that it would cost him a good deal of
trouble to carry it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t think I need keep you any longer,&#8221; he
told Hutton after a long pause. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the thing
over for a day or two, and you can send across to my
hotel if you wish to discuss it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and reached out for his hat, and Hutton, who
watched him cross the room, was once or twice on the
point of calling him back. Hutton did not speak, however,
since he fancied that Nasmyth would presently return
of his own accord&ndash;&ndash;which was an expectation that
proved unwarranted.</p>
<p>The office was on the second floor of a big stone building,
and, as he descended the stairway, Nasmyth fancied
he caught sight of Martial in the entrance-hall. Before
he could be quite sure, the man turned down a corridor,
and Nasmyth, who did not trouble himself about the
matter, went out into the street. He was not altogether
satisfied that he had done wisely, but he meant, at least,
to wait until events should prove him wrong.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Martial strolled into the office
where Hutton sat, and smiled at him suggestively. He
was also, as Acton had once told Nasmyth, interested in
the land exploitation business, and it was evident that
Hutton had expected him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nasmyth has been here,&#8221; Martial observed; &#8220;I saw
him on the stairway. I suppose you got hold of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hutton&#8217;s gesture was forcibly expressive of annoyance.
&#8220;As a matter of fact, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;The
man&#8217;s either considerably smarter than I gave him credit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
for being, or a thick-headed, obstinate fool. The one&#8217;s
as hard to handle as the other. I don&#8217;t know which he
is, and it doesn&#8217;t greatly matter. The result&#8217;s the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s the latter;&#8221; and Martial laughed. &#8220;Well,
since you can&#8217;t come to terms, have you any notion what
his programme is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a sure thing that he has one. Anyway, he
didn&#8217;t mention it. We&#8217;ll let him wait a day or two.
It&#8217;s quite likely he&#8217;ll try the Charters people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of them smiled, for it was then not an unusual
thing for the men interested in such affairs to put their
heads together and take a joint hand in any deal that
seemed to warrant it, and when they did so, the results
were not, as a rule, encouraging to the outsider.</p>
<p>Martial looked at his comrade suggestively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a talk with Charters yesterday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
told me that if there was anything in it, he didn&#8217;t expect
us to let the thing go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hutton thought for a moment. &#8220;One could sell quite
a few ranches in the valley; but it&#8217;s going to cost considerable
to run the water out, and I can&#8217;t quite put my
hand on anybody I&#8217;d feel like trusting with the work in
the ca&ntilde;on. It&#8217;s going to be difficult. Besides, Nasmyth
has what you might call a first option on the land. Nobody
else seems to want it, and the Crown people have
evidently given way on a point or two. It&#8217;s a sure thing
they&#8217;d make no concession if we show our hands.&#8221; He
broke off for a moment, and flung a quick glance at his
visitor. &#8220;You don&#8217;t like the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Martial&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;that&#8217;s a solid fact. Still,
it&#8217;s not going to count for much. This&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and he waved
his hand&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;is a matter of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat still for a moment or two, with a curious look
in his face; for he had called at the hotel Acton&#8217;s party
had visited on the night that he had endeavoured to crawl
unobserved on board the <i>Tillicum</i>. He had no difficulty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
in discovering that Mrs. Acton and Miss Hamilton had
spent the night there, which made it evident that the girl
could not have been on board the steamer. He had,
however, not made the inquiries until business took him
to the hotel several weeks afterwards, and Acton&#8217;s manner,
when they met in the city, convinced him that the
schooner men had been communicative. On thinking the
matter over, it became clear that Nasmyth and the skipper
had played a trick on him; and, since it had cost him
Mrs. Acton&#8217;s good-will, without which he could not
approach Miss Hamilton, he cherished a bitter grievance
against Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;in case he tries to raise the
money elsewhere, what do you suggest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll let him try,&#8221; answered Hutton. &#8220;He&#8217;s
not going to raise much when things are humming and
every man with capital is putting it into mines and mills.
Besides, the work in the ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s evidently a big undertaking,
and it&#8217;s going to run into a long bill for labour. A
thing of that kind usually costs four times as much as the
man who starts it figures. Well, we&#8217;ll leave him to it,
and when his money runs out we&#8217;ll chip in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martial laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s very much my notion. Let
him do the work, and then jump in and put up our
dummies to locate all the land he can&#8217;t take hold of.
Once we get a ranch or two recorded, there would be
a dozen ways we could get a grip on him. Between us
and Charters, we ought to break him.&#8221;</p>
<p>They smiled at each other, but in a moment or two
Hutton looked thoughtful again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to understand,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s not my
business to break Nasmyth. It&#8217;s the money I&#8217;m out for.
In fact, if there&#8217;s an easier way than the one I suggested,
I&#8217;m going to take it; and with that in view, I&#8217;ll send up
a man or two I can rely on to investigate.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If they get crawling round that ca&ntilde;on and up and
down the valley, it will set the blame settlers talking.
We want the thing run quietly,&#8221; Martial cautioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it can be done,&#8221; replied Hutton. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
go camping out for pleasure. In fact, to make the thing
more like it, I&#8217;ll send them fishing.&#8221; Martial rose.
&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it with you in the meanwhile.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE MEN OF THE BUSH</h3>
</div>
<p>A cool shadow fell upon the descending trail that
wound in among the towering firs, and Nasmyth
checked his jaded horse as he entered on the last league
of his long ride from the railroad. The red dust had
settled thick upon his city clothes, and for the first time
he found the restraint of them irksome. The band of
his new hat had tightened unpleasantly about his forehead,
and in scrambling up the side of the last high ridge
which he had crossed, one neatly-fitting boot had galled
his foot, while he smiled with somewhat sinister amusement
as he felt the grip of the tight jacket on his shoulders.
These were, as he recognized, petty troubles, and
he was rather astonished that he should resent them, as
he certainly did. He remembered that a little while
before he had made no complaint against the restraints
of civilization, and had, indeed, begun to shrink from
the prospect of going back to the untrammelled life of
the wilderness.</p>
<p>But, as he straightened himself in his saddle and gazed
down the deep valley through which the trail twisted,
he felt the shrinking melt away. After all, there was
something in the wilderness that appealed to him. There
was vigour in the clean smell of it, and the little breeze
that fanned his face was laden with the scent of the firs.
The trees rolled away before him in sombre battalions
that dwindled far up the rocky sides of the enfolding
hills, and here and there a flood of sunlight that struck
in through the openings fell in streams of burning gold
upon their tremendous trunks. Beyond them the rugged
heights rose, mass on mass, against the western sky.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>He rode into the shadow, and, though he thought of
her, it was curious that Violet Hamilton seemed to become
less real to him as he pushed on down the valley.
He vaguely felt that he could not carry her with him
into the wilderness. She was a part of the civilization
upon which he had once more, for a time at least, turned
his back, and he could not fit her into the environment
of that wild and rugged land. Indeed, he remembered
with a compassionate tenderness how she had shrunk
from it and clung to him&ndash;&ndash;a forlorn, bedraggled object,
in her tattered dress&ndash;&ndash;the day they floundered through
the dripping Bush, and he subconsciously braced himself
for conflict as he thought of it. The sooner his work
was over, the sooner he could go back to her; but there
was, as he remembered, a great deal to be accomplished
first.</p>
<p>Wrapped in thought as he was, he was surprised when
he saw a faint blue cloud of wood-smoke trailing out
athwart the sombre firs in the hollow beneath him. Then
two figures became visible, moving upwards along the
strip of trail, and he drove the jaded horse forward as
he recognized them. He lost sight of them for a few
minutes as he turned aside to avoid a swampy spot, but
when he had left it behind they were close ahead in the
middle of the trail, and it was with a thrill of pleasure
that he swung himself stiffly from the saddle.</p>
<p>With a smile on his bronzed face, Gordon stood looking
at him. Gordon was dressed in soil-stained garments
of old blue duck, with a patch cut from a cotton
flour-bag on one of them. Laura Waynefleet stood a
little nearer, and there was also a welcome in her eyes.
Nasmyth noticed how curiously at home she seemed
amidst that tremendous colonnade of towering trunks.
He shook hands with her, but it was Gordon who spoke
first.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have come back to us. We have been expecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After all, store clothes and three
well-laid meals a day are apt to pall on one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth turned to Laura. &#8220;I should like to point
out that this is the man who urged me to go,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;One can&#8217;t count on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; admitted Gordon, &#8220;I certainly did urge
you, but I guess I knew what the result would be. It
was the surest way of quieting you. Anyway, you don&#8217;t
seem sorry to be back again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced at Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said; &#8220;in some respects I&#8217;m very glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>He became suddenly self-conscious as he saw Gordon&#8217;s
significant smile. It suggested that he had, perhaps,
made too great an admission, and he wondered for the
first time, with a certain uneasiness, whether Gordon
had mentioned Miss Hamilton to Laura, and, if that
was the case, what Miss Waynefleet thought about the
subject.</p>
<p>Laura talked to him in her old friendly fashion as
they walked on towards the settlement, until Gordon
broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve called the boys together, as you suggested, and
fixed up the meeting for to-night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
be ready to give you a hearing, after supper, in the hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura left them on the outskirts of the settlement,
and Gordon, stopping a moment, looked hard at Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you pledged yourself to that girl at Bonavista
before you came away?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; Nasmyth admitted.</p>
<p>Gordon was silent for a moment or two. &#8220;Of course,
I partly expected it,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;In fact, when I
was talking to Miss Waynefleet about you, I ventured
to predict something of the kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other for a moment, and
then Nasmyth smiled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t anything else to say,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Gordon,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;at least, nothing that&#8217;s
very material. Anyway, until we&#8217;re through with the
business we have on hand, you&#8217;ll have to put that girl
right out of your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went on towards the little wooden hotel, and
Nasmyth felt unusually thoughtful as he walked beside
his jaded horse. He recognized that his comrade&#8217;s last
observation was more or less warranted, and it was to
some extent a relief to him when they reached the
veranda stairway and Gordon led the horse away toward
the stables.</p>
<p>It was rather more than an hour later when a specially
invited company of men who had, as they said, a
stake in the district assembled in the big general room
of the hotel. There was about a dozen of them, men
of different birth and upbringing, though all had the
same quiet brown faces and steadiness of gaze. For the
most part, they were dressed in duck, though Waynefleet
and the hotel-keeper wore city clothes. The room
was barely furnished, and panelled roughly with cedar-boards;
but it had wide casements, from which those
who sat in it could look out upon a strip of frothing
river and the sombre forest that rolled up the rocky
hills. The windows were wide open, and the smell of
wood-smoke and the resinous odours of the firs flowed
in. A look of expectancy crept into the men&#8217;s faces, and
the murmur of their conversation suddenly fell away,
when Nasmyth sat down at the head of the long table
with Gordon at one side of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;one or two of you know
why Gordon asked you here to meet me, but I had better
roughly explain my project before I go any further.
I&#8217;ll ask you to give me your close attention for the next
three or four minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he stopped speaking there was a very suggestive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
silence for a moment. Those who heard him had
not the quick temperament of the men of the Western
cities. They lived in the stillness of the Bush, and
thought before they undertook anything, though, when
they moved, it was usually to some purpose. One of
the men stood up with a deprecatory gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;it&#8217;s a great idea. Boys,
wouldn&#8217;t you call us blame fools for not thinking of it
before?&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down suddenly, before anybody answered him,
and the men were still again until another of them rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nasmyth&#8217;s not quite through yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
ask him to go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon leaned forward, and touched his comrade&#8217;s
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pitch it to them strong. You&#8217;re getting hold,&#8221; he
whispered encouragingly.</p>
<p>For another five minutes Nasmyth spoke as he felt
that he had never spoken before. He was intent and
strung up, and he knew that a great deal depended upon
the effect he could make. He had failed with the men
of the cities, who wanted all the profit. He felt sure
that he would henceforward have one or two of them
against him, and it was clear that he must either abandon
his project or win over these hard-handed men of the
Bush. With them behind him, there was, he felt, little
that he need shrink from attempting. A ring crept into
his voice as he went on, for he knew that he was getting
hold as he saw their lips set and the resolute expression
of their eyes. They were men who, by strenuous
toil, wrung a bare living out of the forest, and now
there was laid before them a scheme that in its sheer
daring seized upon their attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; Nasmyth concluded, &#8220;I am in your hands.
This thing is too big for me to go into alone. Still, it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
due to you to say that, while I meant to give you an
option of standing in, it seemed to me it would simplify
the thing if I raised most of the money before I came to
you. Money is usually scarce in the Bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; agreed the shrewd-faced hotel-keeper,
who also conducted the store. &#8220;Anyway, when you have
to trade with folks who take twelve months to square
up their bills in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody seemed to heed him, and Nasmyth added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I found I couldn&#8217;t do it&ndash;&ndash;that is, if I wanted
to keep anything for myself. I want you to come in,
and as soon as I hear you&#8217;re ready to give it your attention,
I&#8217;ll lay a proposition before you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat looking at them, in a state of tense anxiety,
until one of them rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you can count upon every one of us,&#8221; he
announced.</p>
<p>A reassuring murmur ran along the double row of
men, and Nasmyth felt a thrill of exultation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, boys,&#8221; he said with evident gratitude.
&#8220;Now, there are difficulties to be grappled with. To
begin with, the Crown authorities would sooner have
leased the valley to me, and it was some time before
they decided that as a special concession they would sell
it in six hundred and forty acre lots at the lowest figure
for first-class lands. The lots are to be laid off in rectangular
blocks, and as the valley is narrow and winding,
that takes in a proportion of heavy timber on the hill
bench, and will not include quite a strip of natural
prairie, which remains with the Crown. The cost of
the land alone runs close on twenty thousand dollars,
of which, one way or another, I can raise about eight
thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at Wheeler, who sat near the lower end
of the table, and he nodded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My offer stands,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want another twelve thousand dollars,&#8221; said
the hotel-keeper dubiously. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a pile of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little laughter from the men. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
said one of them, &#8220;I guess we can raise it somehow
among us, but it&#8217;s going to be a pull.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;we have provided for the
cost of the land, but before we lower the fall and cut
the drainage trenches in the valley we will run up a
big bill&ndash;&ndash;that is, if we hire hands. My notion is that
we undertake the work ourselves, and credit every man
with his share in it to count as a mortgage on the
whole land that belongs to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet stood up and waved his hand. &#8220;I want to
point out that this is very vague,&#8221; he objected. &#8220;The
question will arise where the labour is to be applied. It
would, for instance, be scarcely judicious to give a
man a claim on everybody else for draining his own
land.&#8221;</p>
<p>He would have said more, but that Tom of Mattawa
laid a hard hand on his shoulder and jerked him back
into his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Tom admonished, &#8220;you just sit down.
When Nasmyth takes this thing in hand he&#8217;ll put it
through quite straight. What you&#8217;d do in a month
wouldn&#8217;t count for five dollars, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed, and Wheeler spoke again. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
get over that trouble by cutting so many big trenches
only for the general benefit. In the meanwhile Mr.
Nasmyth said something about trustees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;The Crown will sell in
rectangular six hundred and forty acre blocks. My proposition
is that we take them up in three separate names.
You have to understand that the man who registers in
the Crown deed is legal owner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re sure of two of them,&#8221; declared the hotel-keeper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
&#8220;Nasmyth takes the first block, and Wheeler
the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler laughed. &#8220;I guess I stand out. As a United
States citizen, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m eligible to record Crown
lands. Still, since Nasmyth and I are putting up a
good many of the dollars, I&#8217;ll nominate Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one man they decided on that, but there appeared
to be a difficulty about the third trustee until Nasmyth
turned to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you don&#8217;t seem sure about him, I would like to
suggest Mr. Waynefleet, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He is a man
who has an extensive acquaintance with business and
legal affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was dead silence for several moments, and the
men looked at one another uneasily. It was evident
that the suggestion was unwelcome to most of them, and
Nasmyth was quite aware that he was doing an unpopular
thing. In the meanwhile dusk had crept up the
valley, and the room was growing dim. Perhaps Waynefleet
could not see his companions&#8217; faces very well, but it
is also possible that, had he been able to do so, he would
not have troubled himself about the hesitation in most
of them. There are men of his kind who appear incapable
of recognizing the fact that they are not regarded
with general favour.</p>
<p>Finally one of the men spoke. &#8220;Seeing that the
scheme is Nasmyth&#8217;s, I guess it&#8217;s only reasonable to fall
in with his views as far as we can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
fix on Waynefleet.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a murmur of very dubious agreement, and
Waynefleet, who stood up, smiled on the assembly patronizingly.
His manner suggested that he was about to
confer a favour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our friend was warranted in mentioning that I have
been accustomed to handling affairs of a somewhat similar
nature, but of considerably greater magnitude,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
said. &#8220;I have pleasure in placing what abilities I possess
at your disposal, gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though it was growing dark, Nasmyth saw the amused
light in Gordon&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m with you in this,&#8221; said
Gordon. &#8220;Still, I scarcely figured the boys would have
stood him.&#8221;</p>
<p>They discussed the scheme at length, and when the
assembly broke up, Waynefleet approached the table
where Gordon, Nasmyth and Wheeler sat under a big
lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a point I did not mention at the time. It
seemed to me it was one that could, perhaps, be arranged,&#8221;
said Waynefleet. &#8220;It is, of course, usual for
a director of any kind to hold a certain financial interest
in the scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at Nasmyth, and made a significant gesture.
&#8220;Unfortunately there are not at the moment more than
a very few dollars at my disposal. The fact, you will
recognize, is likely to hamper my efforts in an administrative
capacity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely!&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;It is a matter I have
provided for. You will be placed in possession of a holding
of the size the others fixed upon as convenient when
the blocks are divided off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No larger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth; &#8220;I am afraid you will
have to be content with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet went out, and Gordon turned to Nasmyth.
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to cost you something,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t
charge it on the scheme. I&#8217;ll divide it with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a slight restraint in Nasmyth&#8217;s manner.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t permit it. It will be charged against
my claim. Considering everything, it was a thing I felt
I had to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Wheeler, who had been quietly watching them,
broke in.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What did you put that image up for, anyway?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>Gordon smiled in a significant fashion. &#8220;It&#8217;s our
friend&#8217;s affair, and I guess he&#8217;s not going to tell you
why he did it. Still, in one sense, I &#8217;most think it was
up to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler let the matter drop, and in a few more minutes
they went out, and Nasmyth and Gordon turned
into the trail that led to Gordon&#8217;s ranch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>NASMYTH SETS TO WORK</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a scorching afternoon on the heights above,
where rocky slope and climbing firs ran far up towards
the blue heavens under a blazing sun, but it was dim
and cool in the misty depths of the ca&ntilde;on. There was
eternal shadow in that tremendous rift, and a savage
desolation rolled away from it; but on this afternoon the
sounds of human activity rang along its dusky walls.
The dull thud of axes fell from a gully that rent the
mountain-side, and now and then a mass of shattered
rock came crashing down, while the sharp clinking of
the drills broke intermittently through the hoarse roar
of the fall. Wet with the spray of the fall, Nasmyth,
stripped to blue shirt and old duck trousers, stood swinging
a heavy hammer, which he brought down upon the
head of the steel bar that his companion held so many
times a minute with rhythmic precision. Though they
changed round now and then, he had done much the
same thing since early morning, and his back and arms
ached almost intolerably; but still the great hammer
whirled about his head, and while he gasped with the
effort, came down with a heavy jar upon the drill. So
intent was he that he did not notice the three figures
scrambling along the narrow log-work staging pinned
against the rocky side above the fall, until his companion
flung a word at him. Turning with a start, he dropped
his hammer.</p>
<p>He saw Gordon hold out a hand to Laura Waynefleet,
who sprang down from the staging upon the strip of
smooth-worn stone that stretched out from the wall of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
the ca&ntilde;on above the fall. Wheeler was a few paces behind
them. Nasmyth looked around for his jacket, and,
remembering that he had left it in the gully, he moved
forward to shake hands with his visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely expected to see any of you here. You
must have had a hard scramble,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gordon waved his hand. &#8220;You don&#8217;t say you&#8217;re
pleased, though after the trouble we&#8217;ve taken, it&#8217;s a
sure thing that you ought to be,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Anyway,
I&#8217;m not going back up that gully until I&#8217;ve had
supper. Wheeler&#8217;s held up because his folks haven&#8217;t sent
him some machines, and I came along to see if I&#8217;d forgotten
how to hold a drill. I don&#8217;t quite know what
Miss Waynefleet came for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura laughed good-humouredly. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I have my excuse. My father is at Victoria, and I have
been staying with Mrs. Potter for a day or two. She
lent me a cayuse to ride over to Fenton&#8217;s ranch, and the
trail there leads close by the head of the gully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa looked up at Gordon with a grin. &#8220;If you
want to do some drilling, you can start right now,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;Guess Nasmyth doesn&#8217;t know he has a back
on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon took up the hammer, and, when Wheeler
went back to the gully to inquire whether one of the
men at work there would undertake some timber-squaring
he wanted done at the mill, Laura Waynefleet and
Nasmyth were left together. It was wetter than was comfortable
near the fall, and, scrambling back across the
staging, they sat down among the boulders near the
foot of the rapid that swirled out of the pool. Nasmyth
looked at Laura, who smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I have taken you away from your work,
and I haven&#8217;t Gordon&#8217;s excuse,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He, at least,
is able to drill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed. &#8220;I observe that Tom seems very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
careful of his hands,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;As to the other
matter, I am very glad you did come. After all, drilling
isn&#8217;t exactly a luxurious occupation; and while, as Tom
remarked, I&#8217;m a little uncertain about my back, I&#8217;m
quite sure I&#8217;m in possession of a pair of arms, because
they ache abominably. Besides&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and his gaze was
whimsically reproachful&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;do you really think any
excuse is needed for coming to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case, I have one; there is something I want
to say. You see, I have not come across you since the
meeting at the settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you object to your father taking any share
in our crazy venture?&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint flicker of colour crept into Laura&#8217;s cheek.
&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;It is the one thing
I could have wished for him; indeed, I shall be thankful
if he takes a sustaining interest in the scheme, as he
seems disposed to do. It will be of benefit to him in
many ways. He grows moody and discontented at the
ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke off for a moment, and her voice had changed
when she went on again. &#8220;There is one point that
troubles me&ndash;&ndash;you provided my father with the money to
take his share in the venture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; explained Nasmyth; &#8220;I think I can say that
I didn&#8217;t. I have merely set apart for him so many acres
of swamp and virgin forest. He will have to earn his
title to them by assisting in what we may call the administration,
as well as by physical labour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura looked at Nasmyth with quiet eyes. &#8220;Would
you or Gordon consider it a good bargain to part with a
single acre for all the advice he can offer you?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>Nasmyth sat silent a moment, gravely regarding her.
There was a little more colour in her face, but her composure
and her fearless honesty appealed to him. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
was attired very plainly in a print dress, made, as he
knew, by her own fingers. The gown had somehow
escaped serious damage in the scramble down the gully.
It harmonized with the pale-tinted stone, and it seemed
to him that its wearer fitted curiously into her surroundings.
He had noticed this often before, and it had
occurred to him that she had acquired something of the
strength and unchangeableness of the wilderness. Perhaps
she had, though it is also possible that the quiet
steadfastness had been born in her, and perfected slowly
under stress and strain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Nasmyth broke out impulsively, &#8220;if it had
been you to whom we made that block over, I could
have abdicated with confidence and have left it all to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura smiled, and Nasmyth became sensible that his
face had grown a deeper red.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever made you say that?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know.&#8221; Nasmyth&#8217;s manner was deprecatory.
&#8220;After all, it&#8217;s hardly fair to hold a man accountable
for everything he may chance to say. Anyway,
I think I meant it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in his voice suggested that he was of the
same mind still, but Laura glanced at him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we getting away from the subject?&#8221; she
queried. &#8220;The land you made over to my father must
have cost you something. It is a thing I rather shrink
from mentioning, but have you any expectation of ever
getting the money back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth did not exactly understand, until a considerable
time afterwards, why he was so deeply stirred by
what she had said, and he was quite mistaken in fancying
that it was merely her courage that touched his heart.
In the meanwhile, he was clearly sensible of at least a
great pity for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he told her, &#8220;we can look at things openly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
and not try to persuade ourselves that they&#8217;re something
else. I think that is one of the things that you have
taught me. Now, suppose I haven&#8217;t any expectation of
the kind you mention. How does that count? Didn&#8217;t
you take me in when you found me lying in the snow?
Isn&#8217;t it practically certain that I owe my life to you?
Admitting all that, is there any reason why you shouldn&#8217;t
permit me to offer you a trifling favour, not for your
own sake, but your father&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment with a forceful gesture.
&#8220;I might, no doubt, have suppressed all this and made
some conventional answer, but, you see, one has to be
honest with you. Can you persuade yourself that I don&#8217;t
know what you have to bear at the ranch, and how your
father&#8217;s moody discontent must burden you? Isn&#8217;t it
clear that if he takes an interest in this project and forgets
to worry about his little troubles, it will make life
easier for both of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura looked at him curiously. &#8220;After all, it is my
life. Why should you be so anxious to make it easier?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question troubled Nasmyth. It seemed to go
beyond the reason he had offered her a moment or two
earlier. Indeed, it flashed upon him that the fact that
he certainly owed a good deal to her was not in itself
quite sufficient to account for the anxiety he felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;if the grounds I mentioned
don&#8217;t appear to warrant my doing what I did, I can&#8217;t
at the moment think of anything more convincing. It&#8217;s
one consolation that you couldn&#8217;t upset the little arrangement
now, if you wanted to. Your father&#8217;s going into
the thing headlong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somewhat to his astonishment the girl appeared embarrassed
as she glanced away from him. It was a
moment or two before she looked around again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to upset it.
He has not been so well and contented for several years.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
It has lifted him out of his moodiness.&#8221; Then she leaned
a little toward him. &#8220;I dare not refuse this favour
from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth was puzzled by a vague something in her
manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly can&#8217;t see why you should want to; but
we&#8217;ll talk of something else,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;As you have
noticed, I have set to work, though I expect it will be
winter before we make any very great impression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura glanced up the gloomy ca&ntilde;on, which was filled
with the river&#8217;s clammy, drifting mist. &#8220;Winter,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;will be terrible here. Then you are not going
back to the coast or Victoria for some time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not, if I can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth spoke without reflection, but he felt what
he said, and it was a moment before he realized that he
might have expressed himself less decisively. He saw
the smile on Laura&#8217;s lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have heard?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;There was, of
course, no reason why Gordon shouldn&#8217;t have told you.
It was a thing I had meant to do myself, only, as it
happened, I haven&#8217;t seen you. After that last speech of
mine, I must explain that I feel there is a certain obligation
on me to stay away. Miss Hamilton, as a matter
of fact, is not engaged to me. Nothing can be settled
until I carry out this project successfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura Waynefleet&#8217;s face was very quiet, and he sat
silent a moment or two, wondering somewhat uneasily
what she was thinking. He was also slightly surprised
at himself, for he realized that, after all, he had found
it considerably easier to stay away than he had expected.
Indeed, during the last few weeks, when every moment
of his time had been occupied, he had thought of nothing
except the work before him. It occurred to him for the
first time that it was curious that he had been able to
do so.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he made haste to explain, &#8220;in the meanwhile
I must endeavour to put everything except this
scheme out of my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he was troubled by Laura Waynefleet&#8217;s little
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said; &#8220;in one way, no doubt, that would
be the wisest course. I&#8217;m not sure, however, that everybody
would have sufficient strength of will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said nothing further for a while, but&ndash;&ndash;though
he was probably not aware of this&ndash;&ndash;his face grew
thoughtful as he gazed at the river until his companion
spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it Miss Hamilton&#8217;s wish that you should make
your mark first?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth decisively; &#8220;I want you
to understand that it was mine. She merely concurred
in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He changed the subject abruptly. &#8220;Tell me about
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so little to tell. One day is so much like
another with me, only I have been rather busier than
usual lately. My father has had to cut down expenses.
We have no hired man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth set his lips and half-consciously closed one
hand. It seemed to him an almost intolerable thing that
this girl should waste her youth and sweetness dragging
out a life of unremitting toil in the lone Bush. Still,
while her father lived, there was nothing else she could
look forward to, and he could imagine how the long
colourless years would roll away with her, while she lost
her freshness and grew hard and worn with petty cares
and labour that needed a stronger arm than hers. She
might grow discontented, he fancied, and perhaps a trifle
bitter, though he could not imagine her becoming querulous.</p>
<p>As yet there was a great patience in her steady eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
Then it became evident that she guessed what he was
thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I feel the prospect in front of me is not
a very attractive one,&#8221; she responded in answer to his
thoughts. &#8220;Still, one can get over that by not regarding
it as a prospect at all. It simplifies the thing when
one takes it day by day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled at him. &#8220;Derrick, you have done wisely.
I think you need a sustaining purpose and a woman to
work for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s face paled. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed dryly; &#8220;it
is, perhaps, rather a significant admission, but I really
think I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a relief to both of them that Wheeler came
floundering along the shingle just then with a box and
a coil of wire in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you a little present, Nasmyth,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Firing by fuse is going to be uncertain when
there&#8217;s so much spray about, and I sent down for this
electric fixing. We can charge it for you at any time at
the mill. Have you put in any giant-powder yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said they had not fired a heavy charge about
the fall, but that there were several holes ready for
filling, and Wheeler&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite anxious to try this little toy,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;When I was young, a rancher gave me an old played-out
shot-gun, and I was out at sun-up next morning to
shoot something. That&#8217;s the kind of being a man is,
Miss Waynefleet. Put any kind of bottled-up power in
his hands, and he feels he must get up and make a bang
with it. After all, I guess it&#8217;s fortunate that he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are all men like that?&#8221; Laura asked with a strange
undertone in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of them,&#8221; said Wheeler, with an air of reflection.
&#8220;Of course, you do run across one here and
there who would put the bottled power carefully away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
for fear that, when it went off, it might hurt him or
somebody. The trouble is that when a man of that
kind at last makes up his mind to use it he&#8217;s quite likely
to find that the power has gradually leaked out of the
bottle. Power&#8217;s a very curious thing. If you don&#8217;t use
it, it has a way of evaporating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon had joined them in the meanwhile, and Laura
looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You agree with that?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Gordon&#8217;s smile was suggestively grim. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I guess our friend now and then says some rather
forceful things. Anyway, he has hit it with this one.
For instance, there was that little matter of the man
who was sick at his mill. A surgeon with nerve and
hands could have fixed him up. We&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and he made an
expressive gesture&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;packed him out to Victoria.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed harshly as he went on: &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s
partly why we&#8217;re going to set our mark on this ca&ntilde;on,
if it&#8217;s only to make it clear that we&#8217;re not quite played
out yet. You&#8217;ll ram that hole full of your strongest
powder, Derrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth turned and waved his hand to a man at the
foot of the gully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring me down the magazine!&#8221; he ordered.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to split that rock before supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man, who disappeared, came back again with an
iron box, and for the next few minutes Nasmyth, who
scrambled about the rocks above the fall, taking a coil
of thin wire with him, was busy. When he rejoined his
companions, he led them a little further down the ca&ntilde;on
until he pointed to a shelf of rock from which they had
a clear view of the fall. A handful of men had clambered
down the gully, and now they stood in a cluster
upon the strip of shingle. Nasmyth indicated them with
a wave of his hand before he held a little wooden box
with brass pegs projecting from it up to Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first big charge we have fired, and they seem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
to feel it&#8217;s something of an event,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In one
way, it&#8217;s a declaration of war we&#8217;re making, and there
is a good deal against us. You fit this plug into the
socket when you&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean me to fire the charge?&#8221; inquired Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Nasmyth quietly. &#8220;It&#8217;s fitting that
you should be the one to set us at our work. If it hadn&#8217;t
been for you, I should certainly not have taken this thing
up, and now I want to feel that you are anxious for our
success.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint flush of colour crept into Laura Waynefleet&#8217;s
face. For one thing, Nasmyth&#8217;s marriage to the
dark-eyed girl whom Gordon had described to her depended
on the success of this venture, and that was a
fact which had its effect on her. Still, she felt, the
scheme would have greater results than that, and, turning
gravely, she glanced at the men who had gathered upon
the shingle. They looked very little and feeble as they
clustered together, in face of that almost overwhelming
manifestation of the great primeval forces against which
they had pitted themselves in the bottom of the tremendous
rift. It seemed curious that they did not shrink
from the roar of the river which rang about them in
sonorous tones, and then, as she looked across the mad
rush of the rapid and the spray-shrouded fall to the stupendous
walls of rock that shut them in, the thing they
had undertaken seemed almost impossible. Wheeler appeared
to guess her thoughts, for he smiled as he pointed
to the duck-clad figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;in one way they&#8217;re an insignificant
crowd. Very little to look at; and this ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s
big. Still, I guess they&#8217;re somehow going through with
the thing. It seems to me&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and he nodded to her with
sudden recognition of her part in the project&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;it was
a pretty idea of Nasmyth&#8217;s when he asked you to start
them at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura remembered that the leader of the men had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
once said that he belonged to her. She smiled, and raised
the hand that held the firing key.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s a big thing you have undertaken&ndash;&ndash;not
the getting of the money, but the beating
of the river, and the raising of tall oats and orchards
where only the sour swamp-grasses grew.&#8221; She turned
and for a moment looked into Nasmyth&#8217;s eyes, as she
added simply: &#8220;Good luck to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dropped her hand upon the little box, and in another
moment or two a rent opened in the smooth-worn
stretch of rock above the fall. Out of it there shot a
blaze of light that seemed to grow in brilliance with
incredible swiftness, until it spread itself apart in a
dazzling corruscation. Then the roar of the river was
drowned in the detonation, and long clouds of smoke
whirled up. Through the smoke rose showers of stones
and masses of leaping rock that smote with a jarring
crash upon the walls of the ca&ntilde;on. After that came a
great splashing that died away suddenly, and there was
only the hoarse roar of the river pouring through the
newly opened gap. Laura turned and handed the box
to Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have done my part, and I am
only sorry that it is such a trifling one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked at her with a gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>He answered softly: &#8220;You are behind it all. It is
due to you that I am making some attempt to use the
little power in my possession, instead of letting it melt
away.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE DERRICK</h3>
</div>
<p>A bitter frost had crept down from the snow-clad
heights that shut the ca&ntilde;on in, and the roar of the
river had fallen to a lower tone, when Nasmyth stood one
morning shivering close by the door of his rude log
shanty at the foot of the gully. The faint grey light was
growing slightly clearer, and he could see the clustering
spruces, in the hollow, gleam spectrally where their dark
masses were streaked with delicate silver filigree. Across
the river there was a dull glimmer from the wall of
rock, which the freezing spray had covered with a
glassy crust. Though it had not been long exposed to
the nipping morning air, Nasmyth felt his damp deer-hide
jacket slowly stiffening, and the edge of the sleeves,
which had been wet through the day before, commenced
to rasp his raw and swollen wrists.</p>
<p>He stood still for a minute or two listening to the
river and stretching himself wearily, for his back and
shoulders ached, and there was a distressful stiffness in
most of his joints that had resulted from exposure, in
spray-drenched clothing, to the stinging frost. This,
however, did not greatly trouble him, since he had
long realized that physical discomfort must be disregarded
if the work was to be carried on. Men, for the
most part, toil strenuously in that wild land. Indeed, it
is only by the tensest effort of which flesh and blood are
capable that the wilderness is broken to man&#8217;s domination,
for throughout much of it costly mechanical appliances
have not as yet displaced well-hardened muscle.</p>
<p>In most cases the Bushman who buys a forest ranch
has scarcely any money left when he has made the purchase.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
He finds the land covered with two-hundred-feet
firs, which must be felled, and sawn up, and rolled into
piles for burning by his own hand, and only those who
have handled trees of that kind can form any clear conception
of the labour such work entails. It is a long time
before the strip of cleared land will yield a scanty sustenance,
and in the meanwhile the Bushman must, every
now and then, hire himself out track-grading on the
railroads or chopping trails to obtain the money that
keeps him in tea and pork and flour. As a rule, he expects
nothing else, and there are times when he does not
get quite enough work. Men reared in this fashion grow
hard and tireless, and Nasmyth had been called upon to
lead a band of them. He had contrived to do it, so far,
but it was not astonishing that the toil had left a mark
on him.</p>
<p>He heard the drifting ice-cake crackle, as it leapt the
fall, and the sharp crash of it upon the boulders in the
rapid. It jarred on the duller roar of the river in intermittent
detonations as each heavy mass swept down.
There was, however, no other sound, and seizing a
hammer, he struck a suspended iron sheet until a voice
fell across the pines from the shadowy gully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll be down soon as it&#8217;s light enough,&#8221; it
said.</p>
<p>Then another voice rose from the shanty.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys won&#8217;t see to make a start for half an
hour,&#8221; it said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know any reason why you
shouldn&#8217;t shut the door and come right in. Breakfast&#8217;s
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth turned and went into the shanty, conscious
that it would cost him an effort to get out of it again.
A stove snapped and crackled in the one room, which
was cosily warm. Gordon and Waynefleet sat before
the two big empty cases that served for table, and Mattawa
was ladling pork on to their plates from a blackened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
frying-pan, Nasmyth sat down and ate hastily, while
the light from the lamp hanging beneath the roof-beams
fell upon his face, which was gaunt and roughened by
the sting of bitter spray and frost. His hands were raw
and cracked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get that rock-dump hove out of the pool
before it&#8217;s dark,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One can&#8217;t see to crawl
over those ice-crusted rocks by firelight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon glanced at Mattawa, who grinned. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
said Mattawa, &#8220;it was only yesterday when I fell in,
and I figured Charly was going right under the fall
the day before. Oh, yes, I guess we&#8217;d better get the
thing through while it&#8217;s light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have felt inclined to wonder if it wouldn&#8217;t be
advisable to suspend operations if this frost continues,&#8221;
said Waynefleet reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our charter lays it down that the work is to be
carried on continuously,&#8221; answered Gordon. &#8220;Still, on
due notice being given, it permits a stoppage of not exceeding
one month, owing to stress of weather or insuperable
natural difficulties. As a matter of fact, even
with the fire going, it&#8217;s practically impossible to keep the
frost out of the stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked up sharply. &#8220;The work goes on.
There will be no stoppage of any kind. We can&#8217;t afford
it. The thing already has cost us two or three times
as much as I had anticipated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon looked amused, though he said nothing further.
Nasmyth was up against it, with his back to the
wall, but that fact had roused all the resolution there
was in him, and he had shown no sign of flinching. It
was evident that he must fight or fail ignominiously, and
he had grown grimmer and more determined as each
fresh obstacle presented itself while the strenuous weeks
rolled on. There was silence for a few minutes, and
then Mattawa grinned at Waynefleet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve got to keep that rock from freezing,
and the fire was kind of low when I last looked out,&#8221;
he remarked.</p>
<p>With a frown of resignation Waynefleet rose wearily
and went out, for it was his part to keep a great fire
going day and night. This was one of the few things
he could do, and, though it entailed a good deal of
sturdy labour with the axe, he had, somewhat to his
comrades&#8217; astonishment, accomplished it reasonably well.
In another minute or two Nasmyth followed him, and
when the rest of the men came clattering down from
the shanty, higher up the gully, they set to work.</p>
<p>There was just light enough to see by, and no more,
for, though the frost was bitter, heavy snow-clouds hung
about the hills. Shingle and boulders were covered with
frozen spray, and long spears of ice stretched out into
the pool below the fall. Now and then a block of ice
drove athwart them with a detonating crackle. The
pool was lower than it had been in summer, and the
stream frothed in angry eddies in the midst of it, where
shattered masses of rock rent by the blasting charges lay
as they had fallen. It was essential that the rock should
be cleared away, and a great redwood log with a rounded
foot let into a socket swung by wire rope guys above the
pool. Another wire rope with a pair of iron claws at
the end of it ran over a block at the head of the log to
the winch below, and the primitive derrick and its fittings
had cost Nasmyth a great deal of money, as well
as a week&#8217;s arduous labour.</p>
<p>They swung the apparatus over the pile of submerged
rock, and, when the claws fell with a splash, they hove
at the winch, two of them at each handle, until a mass
of stone rose from the stream. Then one guy was slackened,
and another hauled upon, until the rock swung
over the shingle across the river, where they let it fall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
Part of the growing pile would be used to build the
road by which they brought supplies down the gully.</p>
<p>In itself the work was arduous enough, since four
men alone could toil at the winch, and some of the
masses they raised were ponderous. Indeed, there was
scarcely room for four persons on the shelf hewn out
above the tail of the pool, and the narrow strip of stone
was slippery with ice. Fine spray that froze on all it
touched whirled about the workers, and every now and
then a heavy fragment that slipped from the claws fell
with a great splash. Nasmyth&#8217;s wrists grew raw from
the rasp of the hide jacket, and wide cracks opened in
his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember it as cold as this only once before,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It was during the few days I spent between the
logging camp and Waynefleet&#8217;s ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa, who hove on the same handle, grinned.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is a tolerable sample of blame
hard weather while it lasts, but we get months of it
back East. Still, I guess we don&#8217;t work then. No, sir,
unless we&#8217;re chopping, we sit tight round the stove.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa was right in this. Excepting the loggers
and the Northwest Police, men do not work in the
open at that temperature back East, nor would they
attempt it on the Pacific Slope were the cold continuous.
In the western half of British Columbia, however, long
periods of severe weather are rare. It is a variable zone,
swept now and then by damp, warm breezes, and men
tell of sheltered valleys where flowers blow the year
round, though very few of those who ramble up and
down the Mountain Province ever chance upon them.
But there are times when the devastating cold of the
Polar regions descends upon the lonely ranges, as it had
done upon the frost-bound ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>Those who toiled with Nasmyth were hardened men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
and they held on with cracked hands clenched on the
winch-handles, or they splashed through the icy shallows
with the water in their boots, until, a little before
their dinner-hour, when three of them stood straining
by Nasmyth&#8217;s side beneath the derrick as a mass of rock
rose slowly to the surface of the pool. Mattawa glanced
at this weight dubiously, and then up at the wire guy
that gleamed with frozen spray high above his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve dropped on to a big one this time,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s going to be heavier when we heave her
clear of the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, of course, was correct, and it was clear to Nasmyth
that it was only by a strenuous effort that his
comrades were raising the stone then. Still, it must be
lifted, and he tightened his grasp upon the handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heave! Lift her out!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The veins rose swollen on their foreheads, and they
gasped as they obeyed him, but as the stone rose dripping
there was an ominous creaking overhead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess she&#8217;s drawing the anchor-bolts,&#8221; cried one.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll fetch the whole thing down. Shall I let her
run?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth flung a sharp glance at the big iron holdfast
sunk in the rock above. There would, he knew, be
trouble if that or the wire guy gave way, but it was
only at some hazard that anything could be done in the
ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he said hoarsely. &#8220;Slack that guy, and
let her swing.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a clink and jar as the clutch took the
weight off them; a wire rope set up a harsh rasping,
and as Gordon jerked a guiding-line across the river,
the great boom swung, trailing the heavy stone just
above the water. Then the ominous creak grew sharper,
and one of them shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump!&#8221; he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s going!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>Two of them sprang on the instant into the pool, and
washed out with the crackling ice-cake into the rapid at
the tail of it. It was precisely what most men who
could swim would have done, but Nasmyth stayed, and
Mattawa stayed with him. Nasmyth did not think
very clearly, but he remembered subconsciously what the
construction of that derrick had cost him. There was a
lever which would release the load and let it run. He
had his hand on it when he turned to his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strip that handle, Tom,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The iron crank that would have hurled him into the
river as its span fell with a rattle, and that was one
peril gone; but the lever he grasped was difficult to move,
and his hands were stiff and numb. Still he persisted,
and Mattawa watched him, because there was only room
for one, until there was a crash above them, and the
tilted top of the great boom came down. Mattawa, flattened
against the rock side, held his breath as the mass of
timber rushed towards the pool, and next moment saw
that Nasmyth was no longer standing on the shelf. Nasmyth
lay partly beneath the shattered winch, and his
face was grey, except for a red scar down one side of it.
His eyes, however, were open, and Mattawa gasped with
relief when he heard the injured man speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;It cleared my body. I&#8217;m fast by the hand,&#8221; said
Nasmyth.</p>
<p>Three or four minutes had slipped by before the rest
scrambled upon the ledge with handspikes, and then it
cost them a determined effort before they moved the redwood
log an inch or two. Gordon, kneeling by Nasmyth&#8217;s
side, drew the crushed arm from under it.
Nasmyth raised himself on one elbow, and lifted a red
and pulpy hand that hung from the wrist. With an
effort that set his face awry, he straightened it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can move it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it got
under the thing, or what hit me in the face.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, either,&#8221; said Gordon quietly.
&#8220;Can you get up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth blinked at him. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;As a general thing, I walk with my legs. They&#8217;re not
hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth staggered to his feet, and, while Gordon
grasped his shoulder, floundered over the log staging
laid athwart the fall and back to the shanty. Gordon
was busy with him there for some time. After the
crushed hand had been bound up Gordon flung the door
open and spoke to the men outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only his hand, and there&#8217;s nothing broken,&#8221; he
announced. &#8220;You can get your dinner. We&#8217;ll see
about heaving the derrick up when you&#8217;ve eaten.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went back and filled Nasmyth&#8217;s pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect it hurts,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;quite enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s any
consolation, but if you expose it at this temperature, it&#8217;s
going to hurt you considerably more. You can&#8217;t do
anything worth while with one hand, and that the one
you don&#8217;t generally use, either. There&#8217;s a rip upon your
face that may give you trouble, too. I&#8217;m going to pack
you out to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficulty is that I&#8217;m not disposed to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your wishes are not going to be consulted. If there&#8217;s
no other way, I&#8217;ll appeal to the boys. I&#8217;d let you stay
if you were a reasonable man, and would lie quiet beside
the stove until that hand got better; but since it&#8217;s quite
clear that nobody could keep you there, you&#8217;re starting
to-morrow for Waynefleet&#8217;s ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon turned to Waynefleet. &#8220;We&#8217;ll lay you off
for a week. There&#8217;s a little business waiting at the settlement,
anyway, and you can see about getting the new
tools and provisions in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet&#8217;s face was expressive of a vast relief. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
few bitter weeks spent in the ca&ntilde;on had taken a good
deal of the keenness he had once displayed out of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly think the arrangement suggested is a very
desirable one,&#8221; he agreed &#8220;I am quite sure that Miss
Waynefleet will have much pleasure in looking after
Nasmyth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon turned to Nasmyth. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you
can protest just as much as you like, but still, as you&#8217;ll
start to-morrow if we have to tie you on to the pack-horse,
it&#8217;s not going to be very much use. You can nurse
your hand for a week, and then go on to Victoria and
see if you can pick up a boring-machine of the kind
we want cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth, who was aware that the machine must be
purchased before very long, submitted with the best grace
he could, and, though his hand was painful, he contrived
to sleep most of the afternoon. Now that he was
disabled and could not work, he began to feel the strain.
He set out with Waynefleet at sunrise next morning, and
they passed the day scrambling over the divide, and
winding in and out among withered fern and thickets as
they descended a rocky valley. Here and there they
found an easier pathway on the snow-sheeted reaches of
a frozen stream, and only left it to plunge once more
into the undergrowth when the ice crackled under them.
They had a pack-horse with them, for now and then one
of the men made a laborious journey to the settlement
for provisions, and in places a fallen tree had been
chopped through or a thicket partly hewn away. That,
however, did little to relieve the difficulties of the march,
for the trail was rudimentary, and the first two leagues
of it would probably have severely taxed the strength of
a vigorous man unaccustomed to the Bush.</p>
<p>But they pushed on, Waynefleet riding when it was
possible, while Nasmyth plodded beside the horse&#8217;s head,
until a cloud of whirling snow broke upon them as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
floundered through a belt of thinner Bush. The snow
wrapped them in its filmy folds, gathering thick upon
their garments and filling their eyes, and Nasmyth grew
anxious as the daylight suddenly died out. They were
in a valley, out of which they could not very well wander
without knowing it, and they stumbled on, smashing into
thickets and swerving round fallen trees, until they
struck a clearer trail, and it was with relief that Nasmyth
saw a tall split-rail fence close in front of him.
He threw a strip of it down, and then turned to Waynefleet
when he dimly made out a blink of light in the
whirling haze of snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will go in and tell Miss Waynefleet, I&#8217;ll try
to put the horse up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Waynefleet swung himself down stiffly and vanished
into the snow. He was half frozen, and it did not occur
to him that Nasmyth had only one hand with which to
loose the harness. It is also possible that he would have
made no protest if it had.</p>
<p>Nasmyth reached the stable, and contrived to find and
to light the lantern, but he discovered that it would be
difficult to do anything more. His sound hand was
numbed. His fingers would not bend, and the buckles
of the harness held, in spite of his efforts, but he persisted.
The struggle he was waging in the ca&ntilde;on had
stirred him curiously, and each fresh obstacle roused him
to a half-savage determination. Though the action sent
a thrill of pain through him, he laid his bound-up hand
upon the headstall, and set his lips as he tore at a buckle.
He felt that if the thing cost him hours of effort he would
not be beaten.</p>
<p>He had, however, let his hand fall back into the bandage
that hung from his neck, when the door opened and
Laura Waynefleet came in. She saw him leaning against
the side of the stall, with a greyness in his face, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
had an angry red scar down one side of it, and her eyes
shone with compassion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth, who straightened himself, shook his head.
&#8220;I can manage it if you will loose the buckles,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;One feels a little awkward with only one hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did it together, and then Nasmyth sat down,
with his face drawn and lined. Laura stood still a moment
or two with the lantern in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The snow must be deep on the divide, and it is a
very rough trail. I suppose you walked all the way?&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth contrived to smile. &#8220;As it happens, I am
used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a flash of indignation in the girl&#8217;s eyes, for
she had, after all, a spice of temper, and she was naturally
acquainted with her father&#8217;s character. Her anger had,
however, disappeared next moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are looking ill,&#8221; she remarked anxiously.</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced down at the bandage. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
working rather hard of late, and this hand is painful.&#8221;
He made a deprecatory gesture. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
excuse to offer for troubling you. Gordon insisted on
sending me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fancy I require one from you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked at her with heavy eyes. &#8220;No,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;it is evident that you don&#8217;t. After all, perhaps
I shouldn&#8217;t have wished to make any excuse. It
seems only natural that when I get hurt, or find myself
in any trouble, I should come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not see the colour that crept into her face, for
his perceptions were not clear then; but he rose with an
effort, and together they went back to the house through
the snow. There Nasmyth changed his clothes for the
dry garments he had brought in a valise strapped to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
pack-saddle, and an hour after supper he fell quietly
asleep in his chair. Then Laura turned to her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;You let him walk all the way when he is worn-out
and hurt!&#8221; she said accusingly.</p>
<p>Waynefleet waved his hand. &#8220;He insisted on it; and
I would like to point out that there is nothing very
much the matter with him. We have all been working
very hard at the ca&ntilde;on; in fact, I quite fail to understand
why you should be so much more concerned about him
than you evidently are about me. I am, however, quite
aware that there would be no use in my showing that
I resented it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura said nothing further. She felt that silence
was wiser, for, after all, her patience now and then
almost failed her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>REALITIES</h3>
</div>
<p>Though there was bitter frost in the ranges, it had
but lightly touched the sheltered forests that shut in
Bonavista. The snow seldom lay long there, and only
a few wisps of it gleamed beneath the northern edge of
the pines. Mrs. Acton, as usual, had gathered a number
of guests about her, and Violet Hamilton sat talking
with one of them in the great drawing-room one evening.
The room was brilliantly lighted, and the soft radiance
gleamed upon the polished parquetry floor, on which
rugs of costly skins were scattered. A fire of snapping
pine-logs blazed in the big English hearth, and a faint
aromatic fragrance crept into the room.</p>
<p>Miss Hamilton leaned back in a softly padded lounge
that was obviously only made for two, and a pleasant-faced,
brown-eyed young Englishman, who had no particular
business in that country, but had gone there
merely for amusement, sat at the other end of it, regarding
her with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he said reflectively, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;m very sorry the snow drove us down from our shooting
camp in the ranges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet laughed. She had met the man before he went
into the mountains, and he had been at Bonavista for
a week or two now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was too cold for you up there?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; answered the man, &#8220;at least, it was certainly
too cold for Jardine, who came out with me. He
got one of his feet nipped sitting out one night with the
rifle on a high ledge in the snow, and when I left him in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
Vancouver the doctor told him it would be a month
before he could wear a boot again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;I have a shrewd suspicion that one
has to get hardened to that kind of thing, and, surely,
this is considerably nicer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; repeated Violet, who fancied she understood
what he meant, &#8220;is very much the same thing as you are
accustomed to in London, except that the houses are, no
doubt, more luxuriously furnished, and the company is
more brilliant and entertaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not expect me to make any admission of
that kind?&#8221; and the man looked at her reproachfully.
&#8220;In any case, it wouldn&#8217;t be warranted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Violet, &#8220;I must have some very erroneous
notions of your English mansions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man smiled. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was referring
to the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had expressed himself in a similar fashion once
or twice before, but Violet did not resent it. She admitted
that she rather liked him, and she did not know
that, although he had been a week or two at Bonavista,
he had only intended to stay there a few days. It had
naturally occurred to Mrs. Acton that there might be
a certain significance in this, but she was misled by the
open manner in which another young woman had annexed
him.</p>
<p>There were other guests in the room, and among them
was a little bald-headed man, whom Violet had heard
had philanthropic tendencies, and was connected with
some emigration scheme. This man was talking to
Acton. He spoke in a didactic manner, tapping one
hand with his gold-rimmed spectacles, and appeared quite
content that the rest should hear him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no doubt that this country offers us a great
field,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In fact, I have already made arrangements
for settling a number of deserving families
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
on the land. What I am particularly pleased with is
the manner in which the man who makes his home here
is brought into close contact with Nature. The effect
of this cannot fail to be what one might term recuperative.
There is a vitality to be drawn from the soil, and
I have of late been urging the manifold advantages of
the simple life upon those who are interesting themselves
in these subjects with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet glanced at her companion, and saw the amusement
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you all talk like that in England?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>The man raised his hand reproachfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
some of us talk a good deal of rubbish now and then.
Still, as a matter of fact, we don&#8217;t round up our sentences
in that precise fashion, as he does. Just now
we&#8217;re rather fragmentary. Of course, he&#8217;s right to some
extent. I&#8217;m fond of the simple life&ndash;&ndash;that is, for a month
or so, when I know that a two days&#8217; ride will land me
in a civilized hotel. The trouble is that most of the
folks who recommend it would certainly go all to bits
in a few weeks after they tried it personally. Can you
fancy our friend yonder chopping tremendous trees, or
walking up to his knees in snow twelve hours with a
flour-bag on his back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet certainly could not. The man was full-fleshed,
plethoric, and heavy of foot, and he spoke with a throaty
gasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tilling of the soil,&#8221; he went on, apparently addressing
anybody who cared to listen, &#8220;is man&#8217;s natural
task, and I think Nature&#8217;s beneficent influences are felt
to their fullest extent in the primeval stillness of these
wonderful Western woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet&#8217;s companion looked up at her with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primeval stillness sounds rather nice, only it
isn&#8217;t still except you go up into the snow upon the peaks,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
he said. &#8220;In most of the other places my trail led
through you can hear the rivers, and they make noise
enough for anything. Now, there&#8217;s a man yonder I
haven&#8217;t seen before, who, I fancy, could tell us something
about it if he liked. His face suggests that he
knows. I mean the one talking to Mrs. Acton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet followed his glance, and saw a man standing
beside Mrs. Acton near the great English hearth; but
his face was turned away from her, and it was a moment
or two before he looked round. Then she started, and
the blood crept into her cheeks as she met Nasmyth&#8217;s
gaze.</p>
<p>He had changed since she last saw him&ndash;&ndash;changed, she
felt, in an almost disconcerting fashion. He wore plain
city clothes, and they hung about him with a suggestive
slackness. His face was darkened and roughened by
exposure to the winter winds; it had grown sharp and
stern, and there was a disfiguring red scar down one
side of it. His eyes were keen and intent, and there
was a look in them that she did not remember having
noticed before, while he seemed to have lost his careless
gracefulness of manner. Even his step seemed different
as he moved towards her. It was, though neither exactly
understood why, a difficult moment for both of them
when he stopped close by her side, and it was made no
easier by the fact that they were not alone. Violet
turned to her companion, who rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Carshalton, from the Old Country,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;This is Mr. Nasmyth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carshalton nodded. &#8220;Glad to meet you. Won&#8217;t you
sit down?&#8221; he said. &#8220;As it happens, I had just pointed
you out to Miss Hamilton. We were talking about the
wilderness&ndash;&ndash;or, to be more precise, the great primeval
stillness. I ventured to suggest that you could tell us
something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled significantly. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
have certainly spent a few months in the wilderness.
That is one of the results.&#8221;</p>
<p>He meant to indicate the hand that hung by his side
in a thick, soft glove by the gesture he made, but it was
the other one that Violet and Carshalton glanced at. It
was scarred and battered, and had opened in raw red
cracks under the frost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Carshalton, &#8220;I think I was quite warranted
in assuring Miss Hamilton that it was a good
deal nicer here. You see, I was up in the ranges for a
week or two. I had to come down with my comrade,
who sat out one night in the snow. The primeval stillness
didn&#8217;t agree with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He met Violet&#8217;s eyes, and next moment glanced across
the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve spoken to Mr. Acton this evening,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a talk about the wilderness
by-and-by, Mr. Nasmyth.&#8221;</p>
<p>He strolled away, and Nasmyth sat down by Violet&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancied the man meant to stay,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>Violet leaned back in the lounge, and looked at him
a moment or two silently. Her thoughts were confused,
and she was uneasy. In the first place, she almost wished
it had not been so easy to make Carshalton understand
that she wished him to go away; for the fact that she
had been able to do so by merely looking at him suggested
that there was at least a certain confidence between
them, and she was unwilling to admit that such was the
case. That, however, was only a minor point. While
Carshalton had spoken of the simple life, and admitted
that a few weeks of it was quite enough for him, she had
thought with a certain tenderness of the man who had
spent months of strenuous toil in the misty depths of the
ca&ntilde;on. She was glad of this, and felt a slight compunction
over the fact that she had seldom thought of him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
of late. Still, when she saw him bearing the marks of
those months of effort on his body and in his worn face,
she was sensible that she shrank from him, as she had
once done from the dreary, dripping wilderness. This
was disconcerting, but she could not drive out the feeling.
His worn face vaguely troubled her, and she was
sorry for him, but she would not have liked to touch his
scarred and roughened hands. She glanced at the injured
hand inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is almost well again. It was crushed beneath a
mass of timber,&#8221; he told her briefly.</p>
<p>Conscious that the meeting so far left a good deal to be
desired, Violet sat still a moment. It certainly had not
afforded her the pleasure she might reasonably have expected,
and she subconsciously resented the fact. There
was also, as she noticed, a suggestion of uneasiness in the
man&#8217;s scarred face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been in Victoria a few days,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;There was a machine I had to buy, and one or two
other matters had to be attended to. Then I got a letter
forwarded from Waynefleet&#8217;s ranch, from which it appeared
that Mr. Acton wished to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint sparkle crept into Violet Hamilton&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;It
is evident,&#8221; she observed, &#8220;that we both find it a little
difficult to say the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I am now and then a little remiss in that
respect. Still, how have I offended?&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet contrived to smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure it was particularly
judicious of you to explain so fully what brought
you here. Couldn&#8217;t you have left me to suggest another
reason that would have been a little more satisfactory?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed. &#8220;My dear, you know I have been
longing to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Violet, &#8220;I am not altogether sure.
Indeed, I could almost fancy that you have been thinking
of nothing beyond what you are doing in that horrible
ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth raised his hand in protest, though Violet
was quick to notice the uneasiness in his face; but now
the worn look in it roused her pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you can show how anxious you
were by staying here at least a week. I want you to stay.
Besides, you must for another reason&ndash;&ndash;you are looking
almost ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was, for the first time, a softness in her voice
that stirred the man, but the uneasiness that had troubled
him did not disappear. Indeed, it seemed to grow
stronger as he glanced about the room, which was furnished
artistically, and flooded with light. Mrs. Acton&#8217;s
guests were of the station to which he had belonged,
and he would once have found the sound of their voices
and their light laughter pleasant. These, however, were
things that no longer appealed to him, and he was conscious
of a feverish impatience to get back to his work
again in the misty ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he replied gravely, &#8220;it will be out of
the question for me to stay just now. There is so much
to do at the ca&ntilde;on; and I think you know why I am so
anxious to carry the work through.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him in a curious fashion, and
though she was probably not aware of it, there was doubt
in her eyes. For the moment she was troubled with a
sense of comprehension, and she could not be quite sure
whether it was only on her account that he was so determined
to carry out the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;I know that Mr. Acton and
your uncle are anxious to see you. In fact, I believe they
have some suggestions to put before you, and though I
do not know exactly what it is, I imagine that you need
not go back to the Bush if you will do what they wish.&#8221;
She broke off and glanced at him wistfully. &#8220;Derrick,
you won&#8217;t decide rashly. I don&#8217;t want you to stay away
from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled reassuringly; but one of Violet&#8217;s companions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
approached them just then, and when she leaned
upon the back of the lounge and spoke to the girl, Nasmyth
rose. He crossed the room, and a few minutes later,
in the big cedar hall, came upon a man connected with
the Crown land agency. There was an open fire in the
hall, and the man, who sat down by it, offered Nasmyth
a cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Acton will excuse us for a few minutes,&#8221; the
Stranger remarked. &#8220;You are evidently fresh from the
Bush. How are you getting on there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth told him, and the man looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t hold all the valley,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;I
wonder if you know that folks are taking an interest in
the land that&#8217;s still unrecorded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Nasmyth. &#8220;It&#8217;s mostly heavy timber
that would cost a deal to clear. Any way, as we couldn&#8217;t
take up any more than we hold, it doesn&#8217;t appear to affect
me at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned his companion, &#8220;that&#8217;s a point I&#8217;m
not quite sure about. You only hold a provisional charter
to lower the river. There&#8217;s only one unworked
holding near the valley, and, as you couldn&#8217;t injure anybody&#8217;s
property, we permitted you to go ahead. Still,
if any parties supplied us with a sufficient reason for withdrawing
that permission, we might have to listen to
them.&#8221; He broke off for a moment and waved his hand.
&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m not speaking officially. I&#8217;m merely
giving you a hint that may be useful. Some persons might
take up that land with the object of putting the screw
on you. You see, it would be possible to get over any
difficulty they might raise by buying them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s lips closed firmly. He was quite aware
that, in view of the state of his finances, the course suggested
was not one that he could adopt.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of people are they?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>His companion laughed in an ominous fashion. &#8220;Small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
ranchers, though it&#8217;s just possible that there may be some
of the big men connected with the land business behind
them. The big promoters occasionally prefer to act
through a dummy. Our object is, of course, to get men
who will cultivate the land, and keep it out of the hands
of anyone who merely wants to hold it. Now, while I&#8217;m
far from sure my superiors would be pleased to hear I&#8217;d
said so much to you, there&#8217;s one piece of advice I can
offer.&#8221; He leaned forward and looked at Nasmyth confidentially.
&#8220;Get that work through as soon as you can.
Once you lower the level of the river, nobody could compel
you to put it back again. Any man who wanted land
would have to buy it as it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man who wished to start a ranch would naturally
prefer it with the water run out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely!&#8221; argued Nasmyth&#8217;s informant. &#8220;That is
why you got the charter. Still, I wasn&#8217;t contemplating
the man who merely wished to ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>His smile suggested that he intended to say no more
upon that subject, and when he turned and glanced
through the doorway into the lighted room, Nasmyth
saw that he was looking at Violet Hamilton. Nasmyth
also noticed that Carshalton was once more seated beside
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather like that Englishman,&#8221; declared the stranger.
&#8220;Acton apparently gets on with him, too. He seems
to have been here some time. In fact, while it&#8217;s nobody
else&#8217;s business, I&#8217;ve been inclined to wonder what
Miss Hamilton thinks of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth made no reply, but the observation slightly
troubled him. A little later Acton crossed the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can give us a few minutes, your uncle and
I have something to put before you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
along with you to my room.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>NASMYTH DECIDES</h3>
</div>
<p>A shaded lamp stood on the table of Acton&#8217;s room,
and, as Nasmyth entered, he saw Wisbech, whom he
had not met since his arrival, sitting just inside the light
of it in a lounge-chair. He strode forward and shook
hands with his uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until I got your letter I almost fancied you were in
Japan,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wisbech smiled at him. &#8220;I shall probably start very
shortly. In fact, I never expected to stay here half so
long as I have done, but I found a good deal to interest
me in this country, and it&#8217;s twenty years since I have
been away from business for more than a week or two.
The works were mine until very recently, but there are
times now when I&#8217;m not altogether sorry I&#8217;m merely a
director of the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton laid a handful of cigars on the table, and drew
out a chair for Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied reflectively, &#8220;there is a good deal
in this country that would interest a sensible man, but
I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s exactly what has kept Mr. Wisbech
so long in Victoria. I&#8217;ve a point or two to mention
later, but I&#8217;ll let him speak first. It&#8217;s his affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth sat down, and he did not immediately notice
that while Acton had placed his chair where the light
struck full upon his face, Wisbech sat a little farther
back in the shadow cast by the shade of the lamp. After
a moment Acton sought the dimmer part of the room.
Wisbech turned to Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that you expect to marry Miss Hamilton
by-and-by,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No doubt you have thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
over the question of what you&#8217;re going to keep a wife
on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit that it&#8217;s one that has caused me a good deal
of anxiety;&#8221; and Nasmyth leaned forward, with his
elbows on the table. &#8220;Still, it hasn&#8217;t troubled me quite
so much of late. If I succeed with the scheme I have
in hand, it will bring me money enough to make a start
with a larger venture of the kind, or to enable me to
undertake ranching on a reasonably extensive scale.
When the land is ready for cultivation, and you haven&#8217;t
to face the initial cost of getting rid of heavy timber, the
business is a profitable one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible that Miss Hamilton would not care to
live at even a tolerably extensive ranch. She has been
accustomed to comfort of every kind and cheerful society,
and there can&#8217;t be very much of either in the Bush;
while, if you undertake any further work of the kind
you suggest, it would be a few years before you made
your mark. Now, I&#8217;m not sure it would be reasonable
to expect a young woman like Miss Hamilton to wait indefinitely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth flushed a little. &#8220;I think,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;that
is a question which concerns Miss Hamilton and me
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton leaned forward in his chair. &#8220;Mrs. Acton
seems to fancy it concerns her, too. In fact, that&#8217;s one
reason why I wrote to you. Well, I&#8217;m going to lay
before you a business proposition. You have probably
heard of the Hecla Mineral Exploitation concern? It&#8217;s
run by two friends of mine, who have made a great deal
of money out of their claims. They&#8217;re getting elderly,
and are open to take in a younger man&ndash;&ndash;a man of education,
who has some acquaintance with the work that&#8217;s
done in the Bush. He must take hold now, and hold
stock in the concern. Here&#8217;s the last letter they wrote
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He passed it across to Nasmyth, whose face grew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
eager, and then suddenly hardened again. The concern
in question was, as he had heard, one of excellent repute,
and supposed to be carrying on a profitable mining
business.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out of the question that I should raise the capital,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The money can be raised,&#8221; Wisbech broke in quietly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy that stock for you, and, if you insist on it,
you can treat it as a loan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth sat very still for a moment or two, and
slowly closed one hard hand. He had never expected
such an offer from Wisbech, and he recognized that it
would free him of all his difficulties if he accepted it.
There was, however, an obstacle in the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked Wisbech very dryly, &#8220;isn&#8217;t the Hecla
Minerals good enough for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked at Acton. &#8220;I must go there&ndash;&ndash;now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is one of the conditions. They want to fix the
thing before Kekewich, who hasn&#8217;t been well lately,
starts East on a trip to Montreal. I promised to wire if
you were willing to go down and see them to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth turned to Wisbech, and his voice was strained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am under many obligations to you already, sir,
but I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t profit by your generosity in this
case,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; queried Wisbech sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little difficult to explain. You see, the idea
of lowering the river was mine. Some of the boys
up yonder have mortgaged their ranches, and put every
dollar they could raise in that way into the scheme. They
look to me to put the thing through; so that they may
get their money back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there no one else who could do that?&#8221; Acton
asked. &#8220;It seems to me there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that
man Gordon. I guess you could leave it to him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth felt that Wisbech was watching him with a
curious intentness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon,&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;is at least as well
fitted to lead the boys as I am. In fact, I might go
farther than that. After all, however, there is a little
more to be said.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly, and sat silent a moment or two,
leaning with one elbow on the table, and the light full
upon his face. There was trouble in his expressive eyes,
but his mouth was tense and grimly resolute. He remembered
the pleasant summer days that he and Violet Hamilton
had spent together, but he also heard the roar of the
river in the misty depths of the ca&ntilde;on, and the crash of
stream-driven pines. The familiar sounds rang in his
ears, rousing him to action, and something in his nature
responded. In the meanwhile there was a heavy silence
in the room. His companions watched him closely, and
Acton, who looked round for a moment, noticed the suggestive
glint in Wisbech&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Nasmyth straightened himself suddenly. &#8220;I know
what I am turning my back upon,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It is
very probable that I shall never get another opportunity
of this kind again. Still, I owe the boys something, and
I feel I owe a little to myself. This scheme in the ca&ntilde;on
is the first big thing I have ever undertaken. I can&#8217;t
quite make the way that I look at it clear to you, but&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and
he brought one hand down on the table in an emphatic
fashion&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I feel that I must go on until it breaks
me or I put it through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisbech noisily thrust his chair back, and Acton
laughed&ndash;&ndash;a laugh that had a faint ring in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I partly expected this,&#8221; said Acton.
&#8220;Mr. Nasmyth, it&#8217;s a sure thing that river&#8217;s not going
to break you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked embarrassed, but next moment Wisbech
laid a hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Derrick,&#8221; he said simply, &#8220;if you had closed with
my offer, I wouldn&#8217;t have blamed you, but I&#8217;d have felt
I had done my duty then, and I&#8217;d never have made you
another. As it is, when things are going wrong, all you
have to do is to send a word to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, to the relief of his companions, Acton, whose
expression changed suddenly, broke in again. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
he commented, &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure that Miss Hamilton
will look at the thing from Nasmyth&#8217;s point of view. I
guess we&#8217;ll leave him to explain it to her and Mrs. Acton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth fancied that the explanation would not be an
easy task. In fact, it was one he shrank from, but it had
to be undertaken, and, leaving the others, he went back
to the drawing-room. Violet Hamilton was surrounded
by several companions, and he did not approach her
until she glanced at him as she slipped out into the big
cedar hall. She sat down on a lounge near the fire, and
he leaned upon the arm of it, looking down on her with
grave misgivings. He recognized that it was scarcely
reasonable to expect that she would be satisfied with the
decision he had made.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen your uncle and Acton?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Nasmyth; &#8220;I have something to tell
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl turned towards him quickly. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; she
said, &#8220;you are not going to do what they proposed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry the thing they suggested was out of the
question. You will let me tell you what it was?&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet made a sign of assent, and Nasmyth spoke
quietly for a minute or two. Then a faint flush crept
into the girl&#8217;s cheeks and a sparkle into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said no!&#8221; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt I had to. There seemed no other course open
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet looked at him in evident bewilderment, and
Nasmyth spoke again deprecatingly. &#8220;You see,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
explained, &#8220;I felt I had to keep faith with those
ranchers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t it occur to you that you had also to keep
faith with me?&#8221; she inquired sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that was the one thing I was trying to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet showed no sign of comprehension, and it was
borne in upon Nasmyth then that, in her place, Laura
Waynefleet would have understood the motives that had
influenced him, and applauded them.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;can&#8217;t you understand that you
have laid an obligation on me to play a creditable part?
I couldn&#8217;t turn my back on my comrades now that they
have mortgaged their possessions, and, though I think
Gordon or one of the others could lead them as well
as I could, when I asked them to join me, I tacitly
pledged myself to hold on until we were crushed or had
achieved success.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her wistfully when he stopped speaking;
but she made a gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one thing clear to me is that if you had done
what Mr. Acton suggested you could have lived in Victoria,
and have seen me almost whenever you wished,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;Some of those ranchers must know a good
deal more about work of the kind you are doing than you
do, and, if you had explained it all to them, they would
have released you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth sighed. Apart from the obligation to his
comrades, there were other motives which had influenced
him. He vaguely felt that it was incumbent on him to
prove his manhood in this arduous grapple with Nature,
and, after a purposeless life, to vindicate himself. The
wilderness, as Gordon had said, had also gotten hold of
him, and that described what had befallen him reasonably
well. There are many men, and among them men of
education, in those Western forests who, having once
taken up the axe and drill, can never wholly let them go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
again. These men grow restless and morose in the cities,
which seldom hold them long. The customs of civilization
pall on them, and content comes to them only when
they toil knee-deep in some frothing rapid, or hew the
new waggon-road through a stupendous forest. Why this
should be they do not exactly know, and very few of
them trouble themselves about the matter. Perhaps it is
a subconscious recognition of the first great task that
was laid on man to subdue the earth and to make it
fruitful. Nasmyth, at least, heard the river. Its hoarse
roar rang insistently in his ears, and he braced himself
for the conflict that must be fought out in the depths
of the ca&ntilde;on. These, however, were feelings that he
could not well express, and once more he doubted Violet&#8217;s
comprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he told her humbly, &#8220;I am sorry; but
there was, I think, only one thing I could do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet, looking up, saw that his face was stern, and became
sensible of a faint and perplexing repulsion from
him. His languid gracefulness had vanished, and he was
no longer gay or amusing. A rugged elemental forcefulness
had come uppermost in him, and this was a thing
she did not understand. Involuntarily she shrank from
this grave, serious man. There was a disfiguring newly
healed cut on one of his cheeks, and his hand was raw
and horribly scarred.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have changed since you were last here,&#8221; she
said, looking at him with disapproval. &#8220;Perhaps you
really are a little sorry to leave me, but I think that is
all. At least, you will not be sorry to get back to the
ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth started a little. It was a thing that he would
at one time certainly not have expected, but he realized
now that he was driven by a fierce impatience to get
back to the work he had undertaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is not astonishing in one respect,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
replied. &#8220;I told you why I feel that I must carry the
project through. The sooner I am successful, the sooner
I can come back to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl laughed somewhat bitterly. &#8220;If you would
only be sensible, you need not go away. Are you quite
sure it is not the project that comes first with you?&#8221; she
questioned.</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt the blood creep into his face, for it suddenly
dawned on him that the suggestion she had made
was to some extent warranted.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he answered quietly, &#8220;you must try to
bear with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet rose. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;when do you go
away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was resentment in the girl&#8217;s expression. &#8220;Since
you have made up your mind to go, I will make no protest,&#8221;
she declared. Then, with a swift change of manner,
she turned and laid her hand upon his arm. &#8220;After
all, I suppose you must go. Derrick, you won&#8217;t stay
away very long!&#8221;</p>
<p>They went into the drawing-room together, and half
an hour had passed when Mrs. Acton beckoned to Nasmyth,
and he followed her into an adjoining alcove.
She sat down and looked at him reproachfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very angry with you,&#8221; she asserted; &#8220;in fact, I
feel distinctly hurt. You have not come up to my expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; replied Nasmyth quietly. &#8220;Still, I&#8217;m
not astonished. Your indignation is perfectly natural. I
felt at the time Mr. Acton made me the offer that he
had been prompted by you. That&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and he made a
deprecatory gesture&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;is one reason why I&#8217;m especially
sorry I couldn&#8217;t profit by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton sat silent a moment or two, regarding
him thoughtfully. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;from now I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
am afraid you must depend upon yourself. I have tried
to be your friend, and it seems that I have failed. Will
you be very long at the ca&ntilde;on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If all goes as I expect it, six months. If not, I may
be a year, or longer. I shall certainly not come back
until I am successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, of course, in one sense the kind of decision
I should expect you to make. It does you credit. Unfortunately,
I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s wise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked at her with quick apprehension. &#8220;I
wonder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you would tell me why it isn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton appeared to weigh her words, &#8220;My views
are, naturally, not always correct,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Even
if they were, I should scarcely expect you to be guided
by them. Still, I think it would not be wise of you to
stay away very long.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose, and smiled at him. &#8220;It is advice that may
be worth taking. Now I must go back to the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth pushed aside the portieres for her, and then
sauntered into the hall, where in a very thoughtful mood,
he sat down by the fire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>ONE NIGHT&#8217;S TASK</h3>
</div>
<p>Daylight was dying out in a flurry of whirling
snow, when Nasmyth, who led a jaded horse, floundered
down from the steep rock slopes of the divide into
the shelter of the dark pines about the head of the gully.
It was a little warmer there, and he was glad of it, for
he was chilled, in spite of the toilsome climb. The dark
boughs wailed above him, tossing athwart his path a
haze of sliding snow, but he caught a faint and reassuring
clink of drills, and straightened himself as he clambered
down between the trees. The sound had a bracing effect
on him, and he felt a curious little thrill as the clamour
of the river came up to him in long pulsations. The
sound of the waters was growing louder when Gordon,
with a big axe in his hand, materialized out of the
shadows, and strode forward impulsively at the sight of
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hand better? We&#8217;re glad to see you; but you might
have stayed another day or two,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; replied he, &#8220;perhaps it&#8217;s
a little curious, considering everything, but I was impatient
to get back again. In fact, I feel more at home
each time I scramble down from the divide.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced round through the sliding snow at the dim
white range and ranks of towering pines, and, as he did
so, the roar of the river and the wail of trees that swayed
beneath a fierce wind filled the rock-walled hollow. Then
the persistent clink of drills and thud of axes broke out
again, while here and there the blurred white figure of a
toiling man emerged from the snow. It was a picture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
that a man unused to the wilderness might have shrunk
from, but Gordon understood his comrade. They were
engaged in a great struggle, with the powers of savage
Nature arrayed against them; but it was with a curious
quickening of all the strength that was in them, mental
and physical, that they braced themselves for the conflict.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a thing or two to tell you, but we&#8217;ll get into
the shanty and have supper first. The boys are just
quitting work,&#8221; remarked Gordon.</p>
<p>They clambered down over a practicable trail, though
part of it was covered deep with snow, crept in and out
among the boulders by the light of a great fire that
blazed above the fall, and found Mattawa laying a meal
out when they reached the shanty. Neither Nasmyth nor
Gordon said anything of consequence until after the meal,
and then Nasmyth, who had put on his deer-hide jacket
and duck trousers, flung himself down in an empty packing-case
that was stuffed with soft spruce twigs, and
looked about him with a smile of contentment. A lamp
hung above him, and its light gleamed upon axes, drills,
iron wedges, and crosscut saws, and made a chequered
pattern of brightness and shadow on the rude log walls.
A glowing stove diffused a cosy warmth, and the little
room was filled with the odours of tobacco and drying
boots and clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you saw Wisbech?&#8221; observed Gordon.
&#8220;Miss Waynefleet told one of the boys, who was through
at the settlement, that she had a note from him asking if
she&#8217;d get a letter he or Acton had written into your
hands as soon as possible. He seems to be making quite
a stay in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has stayed several months longer than he intended,&#8221;
replied Nasmyth. &#8220;I believe he did it on my
account; but he&#8217;s going on again in a week or two. I saw
him at Bonavista. Where&#8217;s Waynefleet?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s in Victoria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come across him. What took him there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon laughed. &#8220;He said it was business. Wanted
to see if we couldn&#8217;t get our tools and powder cheaper.
As a matter of fact, it would be a relief if that could
be done. Any way, he has been working quite hard,
and has hung on rather longer than I expected. Administration&#8217;s
his strong point. He doesn&#8217;t like chopping.&#8221;
Gordon&#8217;s face grew grave. &#8220;In one way it&#8217;s rather a
pity he&#8217;s fond of talking. I&#8217;m &#8217;most afraid somebody
may start him discoursing on what we&#8217;re doing over a
glass of wine and a cigar. I like a man of that kind
where I can put my hand on him. He&#8217;s one of our
weak spots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t know he was
in the city,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How are you getting on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Satisfactorily, so far as the work goes. We have
pushed the blasting heading well under the fall, but
there&#8217;s a thing that has been worrying me. I&#8217;d gone
across the range to see what the boys in the valley had
done, when a man came in. It appears he resented our
trying to lower the river. Mattawa saw him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa looked up with a grin. &#8220;He said he&#8217;d a
claim up at the head of the valley, and we had got to
quit work right away. If we didn&#8217;t he&#8217;d get the Crown
people or the court to stop us. He liked plenty of water
round his ranch. Some of the boys got a little riled with
him, and they took him up the gully and put him on his
horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of a claim up yonder,&#8221; declared Nasmyth
gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Gordon, &#8220;I believe there is one. Somebody
recorded it a long while ago, and did nothing on
it, but, as it was bought land, his title stands. Potter
says he understood the man was dead. It may be an
attempt to get some money out of us.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth sat thoughtfully silent a moment or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the Crown people hinted at something of the
kind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now I scarcely think any of the boys
would go back on us by selling out his land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one. Any way, I guess they could hardly do it
without the consent of the trustees. You and I are not
likely to give ours.&#8221; He paused for a moment. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;I guess Waynefleet could be depended on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said nothing for almost a minute, and both
recognized that the silence was significant. Then he rose
abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one shape or other the trouble you suggested is
one we will have to face,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;m going to fire a big charge in the blasting heading to-night.
You can bring the giant-powder along, Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa appeared to be amazed, and Gordon stared
at his comrade curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you fire that charge now, you&#8217;ll naturally make
an end of the heading, and I understood your notion was
to drive right under the fall and blow the whole ledge
out at one time,&#8221; objected Gordon. &#8220;Guess if you just
rip the top of the rock off, as far as we have gone, it will
take us quite a while to make another tunnel, and money,
as I needn&#8217;t remind you, is running out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; agreed Nasmyth. &#8220;That extra work will
have to be faced, but if I can get a big charge in to-night
I can cut down the ridge a foot or two. Two feet
less water will count for something in the valley, and I&#8217;m
going to make sure of it. It seems certain that somebody
will try to stop us by-and-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon noticed the hard glint in Nasmyth&#8217;s eyes, and
knew that now when he was being pushed back to the
wall he meant to fight, and would not shrink from a
sacrifice. They had driven that uncompleted heading
at a heavy cost, cutting at first an open gallery in the face
of the rock, drenched with the spray of the fall. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
they had crawled into the dripping tunnel hewn out by
sheer force of muscle, for it was seldom that powder
could be used, and they had only a worn-out machine,
and had toiled crouching with scarcely room to bring a
hammer down on wedge or to hold the drill, while from
odd fissures the icy river poured in on them. Now, it
seemed, all that severe effort was to be practically thrown
away, but he recognized that his comrade was right.
It was wiser to make sure of two feet than to wait
until somebody set the law in motion and stopped the
work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he assented simply; &#8220;I guess it has to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa entered with the magazine, and Nasmyth
laid out several sticks of giant-powder near the stove.
There was a certain risk in this, but giant-powder freezes,
and when that happens one must thaw it out. It is a
singularly erratic compound of nitro-glycerine, which requires
to be fired by a powerful detonator, and, if merely
ignited, burns harmlessly. One can warm it at a stove,
or even flatten it with a hammer, without stirring it to
undesired activity&ndash;&ndash;that is, as a rule&ndash;&ndash;but now and then
a chance tap with a pick-handle or a little jolt suffices to
loose its tremendous potentialities. In such cases the men
nearest it are usually not shattered, but dissolved into their
component gases.</p>
<p>Nasmyth was quite aware of this as he sat by the stove
kneading the detonators into the sticks that he held up
to warm. His lips were set, but his scarred hands were
steady, for another risk more or less did not count for
very much in the ca&ntilde;on. Once, however, Mattawa ventured
a protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that stick&#8217;s quite hot enough,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>Nasmyth said nothing, but went on with his work,
until at length he laid the sticks and fuses in the magazine,
and signalling to the others, moved towards the
door. The snow beat into their faces when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
went outside, and the glare of the fire above the
fall emphasized the obscurity. Now the flames flung an
evanescent flash of radiance across the whirling pool and
the dark rock&#8217;s side, and then sank again to a dim smear
of yellow brightness while a haze of vapour whirled
amidst the snow, for a high wind swept through the
ca&ntilde;on. Sometimes they could see the boulders among
which they stumbled, and the river frothing at their feet,
but for the most part they saw nothing, and groped onward
with dazzled eyes, until at last Nasmyth swung
himself up on the narrow staging that overhung the pool
beneath the fall, and Gordon heard the sticks of giant-powder
jolt against the side of the magazine. That alone
would have sufficed to indicate the state of his comrade&#8217;s
temper, for so far as it is possible, men handle giant-powder
very tenderly.</p>
<p>There was no rail to the narrow staging, which was
glazed with frozen spray, and when Gordon was half-way
along it, the fire flung out a gush of radiance and
sank suddenly. Then thick smoke whirled about him,
and for a moment or two he stopped and gasped, feeling
for the rock with a cautious hand. He was aware that
the man who slipped from the staging would be whirled
round with the eddy and drawn down beneath the fall.
A harsh voice came out of the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to wait here half the night?&#8221; it asked.</p>
<p>Gordon went on circumspectly, bruising his numbed
fingers now and then upon the stone, until once more a
blaze broke out, and he saw Nasmyth floundering in
haste over a pile of shattered rock. The magazine was
slung over his shoulder, and now and then it struck his
back or the side of the rock. While Gordon would have
been relieved had his comrade acted more circumspectly,
he was not surprised. There were, he knew, times when
men under strain broke out into an unreasoning fury. He
had seen one hewing savagely on the perilous side of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
tremendous tottering tree, and another grimly driving
the bolts that could not save it into the stringers of a
collapsing wooden bridge. It was, as he recognized, not
exactly courage that they had displayed, but the elemental
savagery that in the newer countries, at least, now and
then seizes on hard-driven men ground down by mortgage-holders,
or ruined by flood and frost. With man and
Nature against them they would make their last grim
protest before they were crushed. Gordon once or twice
had been conscious of the same fierce desire. He could
sympathize with Nasmyth, but, after all, he wished he
would not bang the giant-powder about in that unceremonious
fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave the magazine yonder, and we&#8217;ll bring it along,&#8221;
he cried.</p>
<p>Nasmyth made no answer, but he waited until Gordon
and Mattawa joined him, and they lowered themselves
down from a rock shelf on to a pile of broken rock,
about which the eddy swirled. The spray of the fall
beat upon them, and the roar of it was bewildering, but
the noise was softened when they crawled into the entrance
of a narrow tunnel. Mattawa, with considerable
difficulty, struck a match, and a pale light streamed out
from the little metal lamp he fastened in his hat. The
light showed the ragged roof of the tunnel and the rivulet
of icy water that flowed in the bottom of it. They
crawled forward through the water for a few yards,
vainly trying to avoid the deluge which broke upon them
from the fissures, and finally sat down dripping on a pile
of broken rock. Nasmyth took out his pipe, and was
lighting it when Gordon drew the magazine away from
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might just as well have done that before you
opened the thing,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Anyway, if you
merely want to sit down, it would have been quite as
comfortable in the shanty.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth was silent for several moments; then he
turned to the other two men with a wry smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know how we drove this heading with
the tools we had, but I can&#8217;t think of any means of saving
it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are men with money&ndash;&ndash;Martial,
and more of them&ndash;&ndash;in the cities waiting to take away
from us what we expect to get, and since we have to
fight them, it seems to me advisable to strike where it&#8217;s
possible.&#8221; He laughed harshly. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be two feet
less water in the valley before the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But no heading,&#8221; cried Mattawa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Nasmyth simply, &#8220;we&#8217;ll start another
one. I notice two holes yonder. We&#8217;ll drill a third one,
Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth had been in the saddle since sunrise, in bitter
frost and whirling snow, but he picked up a hammer,
and Mattawa seized a drill. There was no room to
swing the hammer, and Nasmyth struck half crouching,
while, chilly as the heading was, the perspiration dripped
from him, and the veins rose swollen on his forehead. He
was up against it, and a man strikes hardest when he is
pressed back to the wall. Gordon sat and watched them,
but&ndash;&ndash;for the rock rang with each jarring thud&ndash;&ndash;he
wrapped the magazine in his wet jacket, and it was a
relief to him when Nasmyth finally dropped the hammer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;we&#8217;ll fill every hole ram to
the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattawa placed the giant-powder in the holes, and
they crawled back, trailing a couple of thin wires after
them, until they reached the strip of shingle near the
gully, when Nasmyth made the connection with the firing-plug.</p>
<p>A streak of vivid flame leapt out of the rock, and the
detonation was followed by the roar of the river pouring
through the newly opened gap. Nasmyth turned without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
a word and plodded back to the shanty. A group of
men who had scrambled down the gully met him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were a little astonished to see me, boys?&#8221; he
said with a question in his voice. Then he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fired a big charge, and I guess you&#8217;ll have to start
another heading as soon as it&#8217;s sun-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was evident that the men were disconcerted, and an
expostulatory murmur rose from them. It ceased, however,
when Nasmyth waved his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to do it, boys,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>It had cost them strenuous toil to drive that heading,
but one could have fancied that they were satisfied with
the terse assurance he offered them. He had proved himself
fit to lead them, and they had a steadfast confidence
in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; commented one of the men, &#8220;in that case, I
guess all we have to do is to start right off at the other
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth opened the door of the shanty. &#8220;I felt you&#8217;d
look at it that way, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll explain the
thing later. I&#8217;m a little played out to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men plodded away up the gully, and in another
few minutes Nasmyth was sound asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>TIMBER RIGHTS</h3>
</div>
<p>They set to work on the new heading at sunrise next
morning, but it was a week or two before they had
made much of an opening in the rock beneath the fall.
Though Nasmyth had lowered the level of the river a
little, the smooth-worn stone still rose sheer from the
depths of the whirling pool, and the blasting had obliterated
every trace of their previous operations. They were
compelled to make new approaches, and they toiled,
drenched with the icy spray, on frail, slung stages, cutting
sockets for the logs to hold a heavier platform for
the little boring-machine Nasmyth had purchased in Victoria.
When the platform was built, the working face
was narrow, and the rock of a kind that yielded very
slowly to the cutting-tool. They had no power but that
of well-hardened muscle, and none of the workers had
any particular knowledge of engineering.</p>
<p>They pushed the new heading toilsomely beneath the
fall, working in rock fissured by the last explosion,
through which the water poured in on them, while the
river rose when the frost broke up and was succeeded by a
week or two of torrential rain. The water swirled high
among the boulders, and had crept almost to the mouth
of the heading, when one evening Wheeler walked into
the shanty. He said nothing of any consequence until
supper was over, and he then took a newspaper out of his
pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you had any strangers round?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth, with a dry smile. &#8220;That
is, they didn&#8217;t get any farther than the head of the gully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
Two of them turned up one wet day, and when they
found they couldn&#8217;t get down, they explained rather
forcibly what they thought of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler nodded, and handed the paper across to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you did quite right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This should
make it clear that some of the city men with money are
on our trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced at the paper, and saw a notification
that certain timber rights in the forest belt surrounding
the valley had been applied for.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Charters people!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;When I was in
Victoria I had a talk with them. I partly expected something
of the kind. By the way, I got a notification from
the rancher I mentioned that, if I continued operations,
proceedings would be begun against me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They mean business,&#8221; commented Wheeler, with a
snap in his dark eyes. &#8220;It seems to me there are several
of them in the thing, and they evidently expect to get
their hands on the valley one way or another. In all
probability their idea is to let you get most of the work
in, and then scare you into selling out for what they like
to offer. Have you had any big trees coming along
lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Mattawa, &#8220;one or two went over
the fall this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drift logs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two had the branches chopped off them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler made a sign of comprehension. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
predicted, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to see a good many more of that
kind before very long.&#8221; He turned to Nasmyth. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to stay over to-morrow. The mill&#8217;s held up again.
We had an awkward break, and I can&#8217;t get the new fixings
in. You can tell me how you&#8217;re getting on.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked until late that night, and on awakening
next morning found the river higher and thick with
shattered ice. It had also crept into the heading, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
the men who worked in it were knee-deep in water.
They, however, went on as usual, and it was in the
afternoon that several great trees leapt the fall, and,
driving down the rapid, whirled away into the black
depths of the ca&ntilde;on. Wheeler, who stood watching
attentively, nodded as the trees drove by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hemlock. That&#8217;s not going to count for milling
purposes,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>Nasmyth, who came up dripping wet, sat down on a
boulder and took out his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you expect anything else?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Wheeler laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I did. It
seems to me the men who want those timber rights
don&#8217;t figure on doing much milling.&#8221; He looked up
sharply. &#8220;This one&#8217;s red cedar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another great trunk leapt the fall, swept round the
pool, and then brought up with a crash upon the pile of
shattered rock which still lay athwart the head of the
rapid. Nasmyth rose and straightened himself wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a trifle unfortunate I hadn&#8217;t hove that rock
out with the derrick. We&#8217;ll have to take hold if the
log won&#8217;t swing clear,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The tree swung a little, and then the thinner head of
it drove in among the boulders and stuck fast. In
another moment a shout rose from a man standing on
the ledge above the fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a batch of big logs coming along!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>Nasmyth thrust his pipe into his pocket, and Wheeler,
who watched him, nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll jam and pile up,&#8221; said Wheeler. &#8220;I guess
that&#8217;s what the other folks wanted. You have got to
keep them clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another few moments Nasmyth was beating a suspended
iron sheet, and while its clangour broke through
the roar of the river the men floundered towards him
over the shingle. One or two of them had axes, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
the rest, running into the shanty, brought out saws and
handspikes. In the meanwhile a huge log crashed upon
the one held fast, and there was no need to tell any of
the men that those which followed would rapidly pile
up into an inextricable confusion of interlocked timber.
There was only one thing to be done, and that was to
cut away the first log, which would hold them back, as
soon as possible.</p>
<p>The men set to work, two or three of them running
recklessly along the rounded top of the slippery trunk,
which rolled a little as it hammered upon the rock.
Mattawa, with a big crosscut saw, crouched on the half-submerged
pile of stone, and a comrade, who seized its
opposite handle, held himself somehow on the second
trunk by his knees. It was difficult to understand how
they could work at all, but they were accustomed to
toiling under embarrassing conditions. The saw had
hardly bitten through the bark when another log drove
grinding against the rest, and Mattawa&#8217;s companion,
who let the handle go, fell forward on his face. He
was up again in a moment, and after that stuck fast
while log after log drove smashing upon the growing
mass. Sometimes the one he clung to rose up under
him, and sometimes it sank until he crouched in the
water while another great butt crept up upon it, and
it seemed that he must be crushed between them. Still,
the saw rasped steadily through the heaving, grinding
timber. It was perilous work, but it was clear to all
of them that it had to be done.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Nasmyth and Gordon stood knee-deep
amidst the white foam of the rapid. The water
was icy cold, and it was with difficulty they kept their
feet, while every now and then a shower of spray that
leapt out from among the timber fell upon them. The
logs were already two deep at that spot, and one great top
ground steadily forward over the others as its pressed-down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
butt was driven on by those behind. One could
almost have fancied it was bent on escaping from the
horrible confusion of piled-up trunks that moved on one
another under the impact of the flood. More were
sweeping on, and crash after crash rang through the
hoarse clamour of the fall.</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt very feeble as he whirled the heavy
axe about his head, for that mass of timber was impressively
big. He had torn off his deer-hide jacket,
and his soaked blue shirt gaped open to his waist at
every heave of his shoulders. He stood in icy water,
but the perspiration dripped from him as he swung with
every blow. Though some men with good thews and
sinews can never learn to use the axe to any purpose,
he could chop, and the heavy blade he whirled rang
with a rhythmic precision in the widening notch, then
flashed about his head, and fell with a chunk that was
sharp as a whip-crack into the gap again. In between
Gordon&#8217;s axe swept down, and the blades flashed athwart
each other&#8217;s orbits without a check or clash. It requires
years to acquire that kind of proficiency with the axe,
but the result is a perfecting of the co-operation between
will and hardened muscle.</p>
<p>It was fortunate that both could chop, for the men
with the crosscut appeared in difficulties. The tree bent
on the pile of rock, and in straining closed the cut upon
the saw. Another man who had joined them was
endeavouring to hammer a wedge in, but with that
crushing weight against him the attempt seemed futile.
He persisted, however, and stood above the white froth
of the rapid, a puny figure dwarfed by the tremendous
rock wall, whirling what appeared to be a wholly insignificant
hammer. His comrades were scattered about
the grinding mass making ineffective efforts to heave a
butt or top clear of the others with their handspikes,
but there was clearly only one vulnerable point of attack,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
and that was the one Nasmyth and Gordon were
hewing at. Wheeler, who felt the tension, watched
them, clutching hard upon an unlighted pipe. He was
aware that if the mass of timber, which grew rapidly
larger, once wedged itself fast, it might be a month or
two before a flood broke it up; but he had also sense
enough to recognize that, since most of the men&#8217;s efforts
were futile, he might just as well sit still.</p>
<p>The trunk was partly hewn through when the top
of it bent outwards, and Gordon flashed an anxious
glance at it. It was evident that if none of the others
wedged themselves in upon and reinforced it the weight
behind would shortly rend the trunk apart. Then the
position would become a particularly perilous one, for
the whole mass would break away in chaotic ruin, and
he and his comrade stood close in front of it; but he
could not tell how much further strain the tree would
bear, and he recognized that it was desirable to hew
the notch as deep as possible before he relinquished
chopping. The axes rang for another two minutes, and
then there was a sudden crash, and a cry from Wheeler
that was drowned in the tumult of sound that rose
from the liberated timber.</p>
<p>Great logs reared their butts or tops out of the
heaving mass. Some rolled round and disappeared
beneath those that crept upon them, but for a moment
or two the shattered trunk, jammed down by the weight
upon it, held them back from the plunge into the rapid.
It smashed among the rocks that ground and rent it as
it slowly gave way, and Wheeler ran his hardest towards
a strip of shingle that projected a little into the river.
He saw Nasmyth, who had evidently lost his footing,
driving downstream towards it, and knew that in
another moment or two the logs would be upon him.</p>
<p>Nasmyth was not exactly swimming. In fact, strictly
speaking, one cannot swim in a rapid, nor when there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
is only three or four feet of water can one get upon one&#8217;s
feet. He rolled over and over, went down and came
up again, until Wheeler, floundering into the foaming
water, clutched him, and held on desperately, though
he felt that his arm was being drawn out of its socket.
He would probably have been swept away, too, had not
somebody grabbed his jacket, and he heard a hoarse
voice behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heave!&#8221; it said&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;heave!&#8221;</p>
<p>The strain on Wheeler&#8217;s arm became intolerable, but
somehow he held fast, and just then there was an appalling
crash and roar. He felt himself being dragged
backwards, and in another moment fell heavily upon
the shingle with Nasmyth across his feet. Blinking about
him half dazed, he saw the logs drive by, rolling, grinding,
smashing, and falling on one another. Then, as
they whirled down the rapid, and the roar they made
began to die away, he looked round, and saw several
gasping men standing close behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that was quite a near thing,&#8221; said one of
them. &#8220;Any way, in this kind of contract you can
sure figure on trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, as a matter of fact, was perfectly correct, for
it is only at considerable peril to life and limb that
saw-logs are driven down the rivers to a Western mill.
They must be guided through each awkward pass and
frothing rapid, and the men who undertake it spring
with pike and peevie from one to another while the
rolling trunks tumultuously charge on.</p>
<p>Nobody, however, troubled himself any further about
the matter, and in a few more minutes the men had
set to work again heaving the rocks that had held up
the first log out of the river with the derrick. It was
not until supper was over, and he sat with his companions
in the shanty, that Wheeler referred to the affair
again. He looked at Nasmyth with a smile.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s fortunate you got those logs away,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably a little more than the men who
turned them loose on you figured you could do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; agreed Nasmyth, &#8220;is very much my own
opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler filled his pipe. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he said reflectively,
&#8220;anybody can apply for timber rights, and bid for them
at public auction, but the man who secures them must
cut up so many thousand feet every month. Since that&#8217;s
the case, it&#8217;s quite evident that nobody is likely to bid
for timber rights round the valley, except the Charters
people, who have a little mill on the Klatchquot Inlet,
and they&#8217;d probably get the timber rights &#8217;most for
nothing, though they might have to put in a new saw or
two with the object of satisfying the Legislature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather difficult to see how they expect to make
a profit on hemlock in view of what it would cost them
to get the logs there,&#8221; Gordon broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t want to make a profit.&#8221; Wheeler
smiled. &#8220;Seems to me it&#8217;s their programme to get hold
of the rights cheap, and then worry you because they
can&#8217;t run the logs through this ca&ntilde;on. The Legislature
won&#8217;t give you land or rights to do nothing with, and
it&#8217;s quite likely the Charters people will file a notification
that your workings are the obstacle. Still, they&#8217;d
probably make you an offer first. If you let them in
on the ground-floor&ndash;&ndash;handed them a big slice of the
valley or something of the kind&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;d let up on their
timber rights. I&#8217;m not sure they could run good milling
fir to that mill at a profit.&#8221;</p>
<p>A grim look crept into Nasmyth&#8217;s face. Difficulties
were crowding thick upon him, and though he was as
determined as ever on proceeding with the work, he
almost felt that it would be only until they crushed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me we are in the hands of the Charters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
people, unless I can keep the ca&ntilde;on clear,&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>Wheeler&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he returned,
&#8220;they&#8217;re smart. I have, however, come across smart
folks who missed a point or two occasionally. Now, I
saw a couple of red cedar logs among that hemlock.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at Mattawa. &#8220;Tom, you&#8217;ve been round
the head of the valley. Did you strike any trees of that
kind up yonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A few,&#8221; answered Mattawa. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite likely there
are more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sure thing. You and I are going out timber-right
prospecting at sun-up to-morrow. Just now they
can&#8217;t get red cedar shingles fast enough on to the Eastern
markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked up and Gordon laughed a soft laugh,
while Wheeler waved his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone can bid for timber rights,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;Now, our folks are open for any business, and we have
got a mill. It&#8217;s not going to cost much to put a shingle-splitting
plant in. We have easy water-carriage to the
Inlet, where a schooner can load, and the Charters
people would have to tow their raw material right
along to their mill. Besides, that Inlet&#8217;s a blame awkward
place to get a schooner in. It&#8217;s quite clear to me
we could cut shingles way cheaper than they could.&#8221;
He paused for a moment. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if there&#8217;s
milling cedar near the valley, our folks will make their
bid. If Charters wants those rights, he&#8217;ll have to put
up the money, and it&#8217;s quite likely we&#8217;ll take them up
in spite of him if I&#8217;m satisfied with my prospecting. In
that case, we&#8217;re not going to worry you about the ca&ntilde;on.
In fact, we would probably make you a proposition at
so much the log for running the trees down for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He filled his pipe again, and Nasmyth looked at him
with relief in his eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>A PAINFUL DUTY</h3>
</div>
<p>Three months had slipped away since the evening
on which Wheeler had discussed the subject of
shingle-splitting with his companions. Nasmyth stood
outside the shanty in the drenching rain. He was
very wet and miry, and his face was lined and worn,
for the three months of unremitting effort had left their
mark on him. Wheeler had secured the timber rights
in question, and that was one difficulty overcome, but
Nasmyth had excellent reasons for believing that the
men who had cast covetous eyes upon the valley had by
no means abandoned the attempt to get possession of at
least part of it.</p>
<p>He had had flood and frost against him, and his
money was rapidly running out. A wild flood swept
through the ca&ntilde;on. The heading was filled up, so that
no one could even see the mouth of it, and half the
rock he had piled upon the shingle had been swept into
the rapid, where it had formed a dam among the boulders
that could be removed only at a heavy expenditure of
time and powder when the water fell. He was worn
out in body, and savage from being foiled by the swollen
river at each attempt he made, but while the odds
against him were rapidly growing heavier he meant to
fight.</p>
<p>A Siwash Indian whom he had hired as messenger
between the ca&ntilde;on and the settlement had just arrived,
and Gordon, who stood in the doorway of the shanty,
took a newspaper out of the wet packet he had brought.
Gordon turned to Nasmyth when he opened it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wheeler&#8217;s getting ahead,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Here&#8217;s his
announcement that his concern is turning out a high-grade
cedar shingle. That&#8217;s satisfactory so far as it
goes. I don&#8217;t quite know how we&#8217;d have held out if
it hadn&#8217;t been for the money we got from him for
running the logs down.&#8221; Then his voice grew suddenly
eager. &#8220;Try to get hold of the significance of this,
Derrick: &#8216;We have got it on reliable authority that
certain propositions for the exploitation of the virgin
forest-belt beyond the Butte Divide will shortly be laid
before the Legislature. It is expected that liberal support
will be afforded to a project for the making of new
waggon-roads, and we believe that if the scheme is
adopted certain gentlemen in this city will endeavour
to inaugurate a steamboat service with the Western
inlets.&#8217;&#8221; He waved his hand. &#8220;When this particular
paper makes an assertion of that kind, there&#8217;s something
going on,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sure thing that if
those roads are made, it will put another thirty or forty
cents on to every dollar&#8217;s worth of land we&#8217;re holding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; replied Nasmyth, whose tense face did not
relax. &#8220;That is, it would, if we had run the water
out of the valley; but, as it happens, we haven&#8217;t cut
down very much of the fall yet, and this thing is going
to make the men we have against us keener than ever.
They&#8217;re probably plotting how to strike us now. Get
those letters open.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was anxiety in his voice, and Gordon started
when he had ripped open one or two of the envelopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks like business,&#8221; he remarked, as he glanced
at a letter from a lawyer who had once or twice handled
Nasmyth&#8217;s affairs in the city. &#8220;It&#8217;s from Phelps. He
says he has been notified that, unless an agreement can
be arrived at, proceedings will be taken by a man called
Hames, who claims to hold one hundred acres on the
western side of the valley, to restrain you from altering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
the river level. Atterly&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s the man we&#8217;ve heard from
already&ndash;&ndash;it seems, is taking action, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hames?&#8221; repeated Nasmyth. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of
him. Any way, he can&#8217;t hold land on the western side.
We haven&#8217;t sold an acre.&#8221; He stopped a moment, and
looked hard at Gordon. &#8220;That is, I haven&#8217;t sanctioned
it, and I believe there&#8217;s nobody holding a share in the
project who would go back on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon made a gesture indicating his doubt in the
subject, and they looked at each other for half a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t go quite as far as that,&#8221; he replied,
and laughed harshly. &#8220;As it stands recorded, the land
could be transferred to anyone by Waynefleet. Any
way, it seems to be in his block. Phelps cites the boundary-posts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth closed one hand tight. Waynefleet, who
had found the constant wetting too much for him, had
left the ca&ntilde;on a week or two before this morning, on
which it was evident a crisis of some sort was near. He
had complained of severe pains in his back and joints, and
had sent them no word after his departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything from him?&#8221; asked Nasmyth.</p>
<p>Gordon picked out an envelope and opened it.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a note from Miss Waynefleet. She desires you
to ride across at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a troubled face Nasmyth stood still in the rain
another minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the pack-horse and start now,&#8221; he said after
a brief silence. &#8220;When I have seen Miss Waynefleet,
I&#8217;ll go right on to Victoria.&#8221; He turned and gazed at
the river. &#8220;If one could get into the heading by any
means, I&#8217;d fire every stick of giant-powder in it first.
Unfortunately, the thing is out of the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few moments he was scrambling up the gully,
and Gordon, who went into the shanty and lighted his
pipe, sat gazing at the letters very thoughtfully. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
had no money to spare for any legal expenses. Indeed,
he was far from sure they had enough to supply them
with powder and provisions until their task was accomplished.
During the long grim fight in the ca&ntilde;on they
had borne almost all that could be expected of flesh
and blood, and it was unthinkable that the city man, who
sat snug in his office and plotted, should lay grasping
hands upon the profit. Still, that seemed possible now
that somebody had betrayed them.</p>
<p>Meantime, Nasmyth had swung himself into the pack-saddle,
and, in the rain, was scrambling up the rocky
slopes of the divide. He had not changed his clothing,
and it would have availed him little if he had, since
there was a long day&#8217;s ride before him. The trail was
a little easier than it had been, for each man who led
the pack-horse along it had hewn through some obstacle,
but it was still sufficiently difficult, and every here and
there a frothing torrent swept across it. There were
slopes of wet rock to be scrambled over, several leagues
of dripping forest thick with undergrowth that clung
about the narrow trail to be floundered through, and all
the time the great splashes from the boughs or torrential
rain beat upon him. In places he led the pack-horse,
in places he rode, and dusk was closing in when he saw
a blink of light across Waynefleet&#8217;s clearing. In another
few minutes he had led the jaded horse into the stable,
and then, splashed with mire, and with the water running
from his clothes, had limped to the homestead door.</p>
<p>Nasmyth opened the door and saw Laura Waynefleet
sitting by the stove. She started as he came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been expecting you,&#8221; she said. She gave him
her hand and her eyes met his with a look of anxiety.
She noticed his appearance of weariness and the condition
of his clothing. &#8220;I can get you something dry to
put on,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nasmyth, &#8220;you must not trouble. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
would be quite as wet again, soon after I leave here.
If I can borrow a horse, I must push on to the railroad
in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night?&#8221; asked Laura. &#8220;After riding in from the
ca&ntilde;on, it&#8217;s out of the question. Besides, you could never
get through the Willow Ford. Listen to the rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth sank wearily into the nearest chair, and
heard the deluge lash the shingled roof.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it must be done,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>Laura laid supper upon the table, and insisted that he
should eat before she made any reference to the object
she had in hand. Then, while he sat beside the stove
with his clothes steaming, she looked at him steadily,
and a little colour crept into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you can guess why I sent for you?&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your father?&#8221; Nasmyth asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Victoria. He left six days ago. I suppose he
sent you no word that he was going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth very dryly, &#8220;he certainly
didn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think I could have expected it from
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat silent for almost a minute, looking at her with
a troubled air, and though Laura was very quiet, her
manner was vaguely suggestive of tension. It was
Nasmyth who broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you have something to tell me, Miss
Waynefleet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Still, I would sooner you didn&#8217;t,
if it will hurt you. After all, it&#8217;s rather more than possible
that I can arrive at the information by some other
means.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tinge of colour grew plainer in Laura&#8217;s face, but
it was evident that she laid a firm restraint upon herself.
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;it has hurt me horribly already.
I can&#8217;t get over the shame of it. But that isn&#8217;t what I
meant to speak of. I feel&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and her voice grew tense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
and strained&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I must try to save you and the others
from a piece of wicked treachery.&#8221;</p>
<p>She straightened herself, and there was a flash in her
eyes, but Nasmyth raised one hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he protested, almost sternly, &#8220;I can&#8217;t let you
do this. You would remember it ever afterwards with
regret.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl seemed to nerve herself for an effort, and
when she spoke her voice was impressively quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must listen and try to understand,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not only because it would hurt me to see you
and the others tricked out of what you have worked
so hard for that I feel I must tell you. If there was
nothing more than that, I might, perhaps, never have
told you, after all. I want to save my father from a
shameful thing.&#8221; Her voice broke away, and the crimson
flush on her face deepened as she went on again.
&#8220;He has been offering to sell land that can&#8217;t belong to
him,&#8221; she asserted accusingly.</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt sorry for her, and he made an attempt
to offer her a grain of consolation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few acres are really his,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I made them
over to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be his only if he did his share, and when the
scheme proved successful,&#8221; Laura interrupted. &#8220;I know,
if he has sold them, what an opportunity of harassing
you it will give the men who are plotting against you.
Still, now you know, you can, perhaps, break off the
bargain. I want you to do what you can&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and she
glanced at him with a tense look in her eyes&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;if it is
only to save him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; replied Nasmyth quietly, &#8220;is, for quite
another reason, the object I have in view. I would like
you to understand that I have guessed that he had failed
us already. It may be some little consolation. Now,
perhaps, you had better tell me exactly what you know.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>Laura did so, and it proved to be no more than
Nasmyth had suspected. Letters had passed between
Waynefleet and somebody in Victoria, and the day after
he left for that city two men, who had evidently crossed
him on the way, arrived at the ranch. One said his
name was Hames, and his conversation suggested that he
supposed the girl was acquainted with her father&#8217;s affairs.
In any case, what he said made it clear that he
had either purchased, or was about to purchase from
Waynefleet, certain land in the valley. After staying
half an hour, the men had, Laura understood, set out
again for Victoria.</p>
<p>When she had told him this, Nasmyth sat thoughtfully
silent a minute or two. Her courage and hatred
of injustice had stirred him deeply, for he knew what
it must have cost her to discuss the subject of her father&#8217;s
wrongdoing with him. He was also once more overwhelmingly
sorry for her. There was nobody she could
turn to for support or sympathy, and it was evident that
if he succeeded in foiling Hames, it would alienate her
from her father. Waynefleet, he felt, was not likely to
forgive her for the efforts she had made to save him from
being drawn into an act of profitable treachery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said after a moment&#8217;s thought, &#8220;I am
going on to Victoria to see what can be done, but there is
another matter that is troubling me. I wonder if it has
occurred to you that your father will find it very difficult
to stay on at the ranch when the part he has played
becomes apparent. I am almost afraid the boys will be
vindictive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he has not expected to carry on the ranch
much longer. It is heavily mortgaged, and he has been
continually pressed for money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he any plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura smiled wearily. &#8220;He has always plans. I
believe he intends to go to one of the towns on Puget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
Sound, and start a land agency.&#8221; She made a dejected
gesture. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect him to succeed in it, but perhaps
I could earn a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth set his lips tight, and there was concern in
his face. She looked very forlorn, and he knew that
she was friendless. He could hardly bring himself to
contemplate the probability of her being cast adrift,
saddled with a man who, it was evident, would only
involve her in fresh disasters, and, he fancied, reproach
her as the cause of them. A gleam of anger crept into
his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If your father had only held on with us, I could
have saved you this,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>There was a great sadness in Laura&#8217;s smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;he didn&#8217;t, and perhaps you
couldn&#8217;t have expected it of him. He sees only the difficulties,
and I am afraid never tries to face them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt his self-control deserting him. He was
conscious of an almost overwhelming desire to save the
girl from the results of her father&#8217;s dishonesty and folly,
and he could see no way in which it could be done. Then
it was borne in upon him that in another moment or
two he would probably say or do something that he
would regret afterwards, and she would resent, and,
rising stiffly, he held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must push on to the railroad,&#8221; he said, and he
held the hand she gave him in a firm clasp. &#8220;Miss
Waynefleet, you saved my life, and I believe I owe you
quite as much in other ways. It&#8217;s a fact that neither
of us can attempt to disregard. I want you to promise
that you will, at least, not leave the ranch without
telling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura flashed a quick glance at him, and perhaps she
saw more than he suspected in his insistent gaze, for
she strove to draw her hand away. He held it fast,
however, while his nerves thrilled and his heart beat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
furiously. He remembered Violet Hamilton vaguely,
but there came upon him a compelling desire to draw this
girl to whom he owed so much into his arms and comfort
her. They both stood very still a moment, and
Nasmyth heard the snapping of the stove with a startling
distinctness. Then&ndash;&ndash;and it cost him a strenuous effort&ndash;&ndash;he
let her hand go.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will promise,&#8221; he insisted hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Laura, &#8220;before I go away I will
tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth went out into the blackness and the rain,
while Laura sat trembling until she heard the beat of
his horse&#8217;s hoofs. Then she sank lower, a limp huddled
figure, in the canvas chair. The stove snapped noisily,
and the pines outside set up a doleful wailing, but,
except for that, it was very still in the desolate ranch.</p>
<p>Nasmyth rode on until he borrowed a fresh horse from
a man who lived a few miles along the trail. There
was a cheerful light from the windows as he rode into
a little settlement, and the trail to the railroad led
through dripping forest and over a towering range, but
he did not draw bridle. He was aching all over, and
the water ran from his garments, but he scarcely seemed
to feel his weariness then, and he pushed on resolutely
through the rain up the climbing trail.</p>
<p>He remembered very little of that ride afterwards, or
what he thought about during it. The strain of the
last few minutes he had passed at Waynefleet&#8217;s ranch
had left him dazed, and part of his numbness, at least,
was due to weariness. Several times he was almost flung
from the saddle as the horse scrambled down a slope
of rock. Willow-branches lashed him as he pushed
through the thickets, and in one place it was only by
a grim effort that he drove the frightened beast to ford
a flooded creek. Then there was a strip of hillside to
be skirted, where the slope was almost sheer beneath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
the edge of the winding trail, and the rain that drove up
the valley beat into his eyes. Still he held on, and two
hours after sunrise rode half asleep into the little mining
town. There was a train in the station, and, turning
the horse over to a man he met, he climbed, dripping as
he was, into a car.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>A FUTILE SCHEME</h3>
</div>
<p>There was bright sunshine at Bonavista when
Nasmyth, who had been told at the station that
Acton had arrived from Victoria the day before,
limped out from the shadow of the surrounding Bush,
and stood still a moment or two, glancing across the
trim lawn and terrace towards the wooden house. The
spacious dwelling, gay with its brightly painted lattice
shutters, dainty scroll-work, and colonnades of wooden
pillars, rose against the sombre woods, and he wondered
with some anxiety whether Mrs. Acton had many guests
in it. He had no desire to fall in with any strangers,
for he was worn out and aching, and he still wore the
old duck clothing in which he had left the ca&ntilde;on. It
might, he fancied, be possible to slip into the house and
change before he presented himself to Mrs. Acton, though
he was by no means sure that the garments in the valise
he carried in his hand were dry. He could see nobody
on the terrace, and moved forward hastily until he
stopped in consternation as he crossed one of the verandas.
The sunlight streamed in, and Mrs. Acton and
Violet Hamilton sat upon the seat which ran along the
back of it. The girl started when she saw him, and
Nasmyth stood looking down on her, worn in face and
heavy-eyed, with his workman&#8217;s garb clinging, tight and
mire-stained, about his limbs. There was, however, a
certain grimness in his smile. He had seen the girl&#8217;s
start and her momentary shrinking, and it occurred to
him that there was a significance in the fact that it had
not greatly hurt him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I must make my excuses for turning up in this
condition,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;I had to start for the railroad
at a moment&#8217;s notice, and it rained all the way,
while, when I reached it, the train was in the dep&ocirc;t.
You see, my business is rather urgent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton laughed. &#8220;Evidently,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
think we were both a trifle startled when we saw you.
I should be sorry to hear that anything had gone seriously
wrong, but you remind one of the man who brought the
news of Flodden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth made a quick gesture of denial. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
he announced bravely, &#8220;our standard is flying yet, and I
almost think we can make another rally or two. Still,
I have come for reinforcements. Mr. Acton is in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is. As it happened, he came up from Victoria
yesterday. I believe he is discussing some repairs to the
steamer with George just now. I&#8217;ll send you out a
plate of something and a glass of wine. You can&#8217;t have
had any lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton rose, and Nasmyth, who sat down, looked
at Violet with a smile. She was evidently not quite at
ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really haven&#8217;t welcomed me very effusively,&#8221;
he remarked.</p>
<p>The girl flushed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could be blamed
for that,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;I was startled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And perhaps just a little annoyed?&#8221;</p>
<p>The colour grew plainer in Violet&#8217;s cheeks. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
she averred, &#8220;that isn&#8217;t so very unnatural. After all,
I don&#8217;t mind admitting that I wish you hadn&#8217;t come
like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth glanced down at his attire, and nodded
gravely. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly not altogether becoming,&#8221; he
admitted. &#8220;I made that hole drilling, but I fancied I
had mended the thing. Still, you see, I had to start on
the moment, and I rode most of twenty-four hours in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
the rain. I suppose&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and he hesitated while he studied
her face&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I might have tidied myself at the dep&ocirc;t,
but, as it happened, I didn&#8217;t think of it, which was, no
doubt, very wrong of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was, at least, a little inconsiderate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed good-humouredly, though he recognized
that neither his weariness nor the fact that it
must manifestly be business of some consequence that
had brought him there in that guise had any weight with
her. He had, after all, a wide toleration, and he
acknowledged to himself that her resentment was not
unreasonable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt that I was inconsiderate,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Still, you see, I was worried about our affairs in the
ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ca&ntilde;on!&#8221; repeated Violet reproachfully. &#8220;It is
always the ca&ntilde;on. I wonder if you remember that it
is at least a month since you have written a line to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth was disconcerted, for a moment&#8217;s reflection
convinced him that the accusation was true.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he confessed, &#8220;I have certainly been shamefully
remiss. Of course, I was busy from dawn to
sunset, but, after all, I&#8217;m afraid that is really no excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl frowned. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a slight relief to Nasmyth that a maid appeared
just then, and he took a glass of wine from the
tray she laid upon a little table.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the brightest eyes in this Province!&#8221; he said,
when the servant had gone, and, emptying the glass, he
fell upon the food voraciously.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that in such unattractive guise he
had come upon Violet, and the fashion in which he ate
also had its effect on her. In the last thirty hours he had
had only one hasty meal, and he showed a voracity that
offended her fastidious taste. He was worn out and
anxious, and since all his thoughts were fixed upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
business that he had in hand, he could not rouse himself
to act according to the manner expected of a lover who
returns after a long absence. It was, however, once
more borne in upon him that this was significant.</p>
<p>Violet, on her part, felt repelled by him. He was
gaunt and lean, and the state of his garments had
shocked her. His hands were hard and battered. She
was very dainty, and in some respects unduly sensitive,
and it did not occur to her that it would have been more
natural if, in place of shrinking, she had been sensible
only of a tender pity for him. Perhaps there were excuses
for her attitude. She had never been brought into
contact with the grim realities of life, and it is only from
those whom that befalls that one can expect the wide
sympathy which springs from comprehension. Nasmyth,
lounging at Bonavista with amusing speeches on his lips
and his air of easy deference, had been a somewhat
romantic figure, and the glimpses of the struggle in the
Bush that he had given her had appealed to her imagination.
She could feel the thrill of it when she saw it
through his eyes with all the unpleasantly realistic features
carefully wiped out, but it was different now that
he had come back to her with the dust and stain of the
conflict fresh upon him. The evidences of his strife were
only repulsive, and she shrank from them. She watched
him with a growing impatience until he rose and laid his
empty plate aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;you will excuse me. I must
see Mr. Acton as soon as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not in any way a tactful speech, and Violet
resented it. The man, it seemed, had only deferred the
business he had on hand for a meal. She looked at him
with her displeasure flashing in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I should, of course, be
sorry to keep you away from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth gazed at her curiously, but he did not reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
He went away from her. A few minutes later when he
entered Acton&#8217;s room he was attired in conventional
fashion. His host shook hands with him, and then
leaned back in a chair, waiting for him to speak, which
he did with a trace of diffidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;My object is to borrow money,&#8221; he explained
frankly. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t resent it in the least if you sent me
on to somebody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hear what you have to say in the first case,&#8221;
replied Acton. &#8220;You had better explain exactly how
you stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth did so as clearly as he could, and Acton
looked at him thoughtfully for a moment or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been partly expecting this,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;It&#8217;s
quite clear that one or two of the big land exploitation
people have a hand in the thing. I guess I could put
my finger right down on them. You said the man&#8217;s
name was Hames?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said it was, and Acton sat thinking for several
minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me that the folks I have in my mind
haven&#8217;t been quite smart enough,&#8221; he declared at length.
&#8220;They should have put up a sounder man. As it happens,
I know a little about the one they fixed upon. Mr.
Hames is what you could call a professional claim-jumper,
and it&#8217;s fortunate that there&#8217;s a weak spot or
two in his career.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton paused, and Nasmyth waited in tense expectancy
until the older man turned to him again, with a twinkle
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost think I can take a hand in this thing, and
to commence with, we&#8217;ll go down to Victoria this afternoon
and call on Mr. Hames,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If he has
bought that land, it will probably be registered in his
name. The men you have against you are rather fond
of working in the dark. Then we come to another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
point&ndash;&ndash;what it would be wisest to do with Waynefleet, who
went back on you. You said he had a mortgage on his
ranch. You know who holds it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth said he did not know, and Acton nodded.
&#8220;Any way,&#8221; he rejoined, &#8220;we can ascertain it in the
city. Now, I guess you would like that man run right
out of the neighbourhood? It would be safest, and it
might perhaps be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth was startled by this suggestion, and with a
thoughtful face he sat wondering what was most advisable.
He bore Waynefleet very little good-will, but
it was clear that Laura must share any trouble that
befell her father, and he could not at any cost lay a
heavier load upon her. He was conscious that Acton
was watching him intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he objected, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want him driven out. In
fact, I should be satisfied with making it impossible for
him to enter into any arrangement of the kind again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, I guess we&#8217;ll try to buy up his mortgage,&#8221;
remarked Acton. &#8220;Land&#8217;s going to be dearer
in that district presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked at him with a little confusion. &#8220;It
is very kind, but, after all, I have no claim on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Acton, with a smile, &#8220;you haven&#8217;t in
one way. This is, however, a kind of thing I&#8217;m more
at home in than you seem to be, and there was a little
promise I made your uncle. For another thing&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and
he waved his hand&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take a reasonable
profit out of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth made no further objections, and they set
out for Victoria that afternoon. Hames was, however,
not readily traced; and when, on the following morning,
they sat in Acton&#8217;s office waiting his appearance, Nasmyth
was conscious of a painful uncertainty. Acton, with a
smile on his face, leaned back in his chair until Hames was
shown in. Hames was a big, bronze-faced man, plainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
dressed in city clothes, but there was, Nasmyth noticed,
a trace of half-furtive uneasiness in his eyes. Acton
looked up at him quietly, and let him stand for several
moments. Then he waved his hand toward a
chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down? We have got to have a talk,&#8221;
said Acton. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come right to the point. You have
have been buying land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hames sat down. &#8220;I can&#8217;t quite figure how that concerns
you,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to worry about
it, any way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want that land&ndash;&ndash;the block you bought from
Waynefleet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not for sale,&#8221; asserted Hames. &#8220;If you have
nothing else to put before me, I&#8217;ll get on. I&#8217;m busy this
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton leaned forward in his chair. &#8220;When I&#8217;m in
the city, I&#8217;m usually busy, too,&#8221; he said; &#8220;in fact, I&#8217;ve
just three or four minutes to spare for you, and I expect
to get through in that time. To begin with, you sent
Mr. Hutton a note from your hotel when my clerk came
for you. He never got it. You can have it back unopened.
I can guess what&#8217;s in the thing.&#8221; He handed
Hames an envelope. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;you can
make a fuss about it, but I guess it wouldn&#8217;t be wise.
Hutton doesn&#8217;t know quite as much about you as I do.
I&#8217;ve had a finger in most of what has been done in this
Province the last few years, and it&#8217;s not often I forget a
man. Well, I guess I could mention one or two little
affairs that were not altogether creditable which you had
a share in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hames laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, what you don&#8217;t know is that I&#8217;m on the inside
track of what was done when the Hobson folks jumped
the Black Crag claim. There was considerable trouble
over the matter.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>Nasmyth saw Hames start, but he apparently braced
himself with an effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any way,&#8221; replied Hames, &#8220;that was &#8217;most four
years ago, and there&#8217;s not a man who had a hand in it
in this Province now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton shook his head. &#8220;There&#8217;s one. I can put my
hand on your partner Okanagon Jim just when I want
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Hames was alarmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim was drowned crossing the river the night the
water broke into the Black Crag shaft,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;His horse was, and the boys found his hat. That,
however, is quite a played-out trick. If you&#8217;re not
satisfied, I can fix it for you to meet him here any time
you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hames made a motion of acknowledgment. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want to see him&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s a sure thing! I guess you know
it was fortunate that Jim and two or three of the other
boys got out of the shaft that night. Well, I guess that
takes me. If Jim&#8217;s around, I&#8217;ll put down my cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wisest,&#8221; advised Acton. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;m going to
buy that land Waynefleet sold from you&ndash;&ndash;or, rather, he&#8217;s
going to give you your money back for it. You can
arrange the thing with Hutton&ndash;&ndash;who, I believe, supplied
the money&ndash;&ndash;afterwards as best you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth fancied Hames was relieved that no more
was expected from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m in your hands,&#8221; observed Hames.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Acton said, &#8220;you can wait in my clerk&#8217;s
office until I&#8217;m ready to go over with you to Waynefleet&#8217;s
hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hames went out, and Acton turned to Nasmyth.
&#8220;He was hired with a few others to jump the claim he
mentioned, and there was trouble over it. As usual,
just what happened never quite came out, but that man
left his partner to face the boys, who scarcely managed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
to escape with their lives that night. The man who
holds Waynefleet&#8217;s mortgage should be here at any moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man arrived in a few minutes. After he had
sat down and had taken the cigar Acton offered him, he
was ready to talk business.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a mortgage on Rancher Waynefleet&#8217;s holding
in the Bush,&#8221; said Acton. &#8220;I understand you&#8217;ve had
some trouble in getting what he owes you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s certainly the case,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I bought up quite a lot of land before I laid
down the mill, but after I did that I let most of it go.
In fact, I&#8217;m quite willing to let up on Waynefleet&#8217;s
holding, too. I can&#8217;t get a dollar out of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you offered to sell the mortgage to anybody?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Martial and the Charters people not long
ago. They&#8217;d give about eighty cents on the dollar.
Hutton said he&#8217;d make me a bid, but he didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Acton, &#8220;my friend here wants that
ranch for a particular purpose. He&#8217;d bid you ninety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it. If the new roads that have been
suggested are made, the ranch ought to bring me a little
more. Still, I don&#8217;t mind letting you in at what I gave
for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton looked at Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Acton, &#8220;we&#8217;ll call it a bargain. You
can write me a note to that effect, and I&#8217;ll send my clerk
across with the papers presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man went out a few minutes later, and Acton
rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll charge you bank interest; but if you care to
put the mortgage up for sale, you&#8217;ll get your money
back &#8217;most any time after they start those roads,&#8221; Acton
said to Nasmyth. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll go along and call on
Waynefleet.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went out with Hames, and a little while later
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
came upon Waynefleet sitting on the veranda of a second-rate
hotel. He was dressed immaculately, and with
a cigar in his hand, lay in a big chair. He started when
he saw them. Hames grinned, and sat down close in
front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back on my bargain. I want my money
and you can keep your land,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The fact is
Mr. Acton has got on my trail, and he&#8217;s not the kind of
man I have any use for fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was consternation in Waynefleet&#8217;s face, but he
straightened himself with an effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have brought this man, Mr. Nasmyth,
and I scarcely think it is quite what one would have
expected from you&ndash;&ndash;at least, until you had afforded
me the opportunity of offering you an explanation,&#8221; he
blustered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you offer me one that any sensible man would
listen to?&#8221; Nasmyth asked sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t,&#8221; Acton broke in. &#8220;We&#8217;re out on business.
You may as well make it clear that we understand
the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet turned and looked at Acton with lifted
brows, and had he been less angry, Nasmyth could have
laughed at his attitude. Waynefleet&#8217;s air of supercilious
resentment was inimitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have some interest in this affair?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; answered Acton cheerfully. &#8220;Still, you
needn&#8217;t worry about me. All you have to do is to hand
this man over the money and record the new sale. We
don&#8217;t want any unpleasantness, but it has to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet appeared to recognize that there was no
remedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case there is the difficulty that I can&#8217;t quite
raise the amount paid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Travelling and my
stay in the city have cost me something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much are you short?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>&#8220;About a hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; replied Acton, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take a bill for the
money. We&#8217;ll go along and record the sale as soon as
Mr. Nasmyth&#8217;s ready. I expect he has something to say
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acton went into the hotel with Hames, and there was
an awkward silence when they had disappeared. Nasmyth
leaned against a wooden pillar, and Waynefleet
sat still, waiting for him to speak. Nasmyth turned to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would, perhaps, be preferable to regard this affair
from a strictly business point of view,&#8221; said Nasmyth.
&#8220;You are, of course, in our hands, but to save your
credit and to protect Miss Waynefleet from any embarrassment,
we shall probably not insist upon your handing
over the land to anybody else. I think we are safe in
doing that. Now that you have signally failed, you will
not have nerve enough to attempt to betray us again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet waved his hand. &#8220;I resent the attitude
you have adopted. It is not by any means what I am
accustomed to, or should have expected from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth felt a faint, contemptuous pity for the man,
who still endeavoured to retain his formality of manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that hasn&#8217;t any great effect on me, and
my attitude is, at least, a natural one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe
that Gordon and I can arrange that the boys do
not hear of your recent action, and though you will take
no further part in our affairs, you will stay on at the
ranch. I may mention that I have just bought up your
mortgage.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flush of anger showed in Waynefleet&#8217;s cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it in any way your business where I live?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nasmyth, &#8220;not in the least&ndash;&ndash;that is,
as far as it affects yourself. Still, I am determined that
Miss Waynefleet shall have no fresh cause for anxiety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
I don&#8217;t mind admitting that I owe a great deal to her.&#8221;
He paused for a moment, and then turned to Waynefleet
with a forceful gesture. &#8220;When you have bought
back the land from Hames, I don&#8217;t suppose you will have
a dollar in your possession, and the ranch belongs to
me. As I said, you will stay&ndash;&ndash;at least, until you can
satisfy me that you can maintain yourself and Miss
Waynefleet in some degree of comfort if you go away.
Now I believe the others are waiting. We will go along
and get the sale recorded.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>SECOND THOUGHTS</h3>
</div>
<p>It was getting dusk when Wheeler swung himself from
the saddle near the head of the gully and, with the
bridle of the jaded horse in his hand, stood still a
few moments looking about him. A wonderful green
transparency still shone high up above the peaks, whose
jagged edges cut into it sharply with the cold blue-white
gleam of snow, but upon the lower slopes there was a
balmy softness in the air, which was heavy with the
odours of fir and cedar. Summer was breaking suddenly
upon the mountain-land, but Wheeler, who had crossed
the divide in bright sunshine, was sensible of a certain
shrinking as he glanced down into the depths of the
ca&ntilde;on. A chilly mist streamed up out of it, and the
great rift looked black and grim and forbidding.</p>
<p>Wheeler noticed a dusky figure beneath the firs, and,
moving towards it, came upon a man with a pipe in his
hand, sitting upon a fallen tree. In view of the strenuous
activity that was the rule in the ca&ntilde;on, such leisure was
unusual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;you don&#8217;t seem busy, any
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking out,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ve had my eye on you for the last few minutes,
and a stranger wouldn&#8217;t have got quite so far. You
haven&#8217;t got any papers from the courts on you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Wheeler, who noticed that there was a
rifle lying near the man, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t. Still, if I&#8217;d looked
like a lawyer or a court officer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; asserted the man, &#8220;it&#8217;s a sure thing you
wouldn&#8217;t have got in. The boys have enough giant-powder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
rammed into the heading to lift the bottom right
out of the ca&ntilde;on two minutes after any suspicious stranger
comes along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler laughed, for it was evident to him that Nasmyth
had been taking precautions, and, turning away, he
led his horse down the gully. It grew colder as he proceeded,
and a chilly breeze swept the white mist about
him. The trees, that shook big drops of moisture down
on him, were wailing, but he could hear them only faintly
through the clamour of the fall. He left the horse with
a man he came upon lower down, and, reaching the
shingle at the water&#8217;s edge, saw the great derrick swing
black athwart the glare of a big fire. The smoke whirled
about the dark rock wall, and here and there dusky figures
were toiling knee-deep amid the white froth of the
rapid. The figures emerged from the blackness and vanished
into it again, as the flickering radiance rose and
fell. Scrambling to the ledge above the fall, Wheeler
found two men standing near the mouth of the heading,
which was just level with the pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Nasmyth, boys?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inside,&#8221; answered one of the men. &#8220;Guess he&#8217;s
wedging up the heading. If you want him, you&#8217;d better
crawl right in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler glanced down at the black mouth of the tunnel,
on which the streaming radiance fell. He fancied
that the river flowed into it, and the man&#8217;s suggestion
did not appeal to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell him that I&#8217;d like a talk with him?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>The man laughed. &#8220;Guess that&#8217;s not going to bring
him. It will be daylight, any way, before he lets up.
You&#8217;ll have to go right in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler dropped cautiously upon a slippery staging,
across which the water flowed, and, crawling into the
heading, with a blinking light in his eyes, fell into a sled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
that was loaded with broken rock. He crept round
the obstruction, and a few moments later found himself
knee-deep in water before a little dam that had been
thrown across the heading. The heading dipped sharply
beyond it, which somewhat astonished him, and when he
had climbed over the barricade, he descended cautiously,
groping towards another light. Big drops of water fell
upon him, and here and there a jet of it spurted out. At
last he stopped, and saw Nasmyth lying, partly raised on
one elbow, in an inch or two of water, while he painfully
swung a heavy hammer. The heading was lined
with stout pillars, made of sawn-up firs, and Nasmyth
appeared to be driving a wedge under one of them. Two
or three other men were putting heavy masses of timber
into place.</p>
<p>The smoky flame of a little lamp flared upon the rock
above, which trickled with moisture, and the light fell
upon Nasmyth&#8217;s wet face, which was deeply flushed.
Nasmyth gasped heavily, and great splashes of sand and
mire lay thick upon his torn, drenched shirt. He appeared
to see Wheeler, for he looked up, but he did not
stop until he had driven the wedge in. Then he rose to
his knees and stretched himself wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rock&#8217;s badly fissured. We&#8217;ve got to get double
timbers in as soon as we can,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to do some boring. We&#8217;ll go along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler crept after him down the inclined heading
until they reached the spot where Gordon sat crouched
over a machine. Gordon did not move until Nasmyth
seized his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get back to the wedging, and send two or
three boys along to heave the water out. I&#8217;ll keep this
thing going,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gordon, who greeted Wheeler, floundered away, and
Wheeler sat down in the dryest spot he could find, while
Nasmyth grasped the handle of the machine.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t smoke,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; replied Wheeler, &#8220;is a point I&#8217;m not quite
sure about. How many sticks of giant-powder have you
rammed into this heading? As you know, it&#8217;s apt to be
a little uncertain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed as he glanced at the flaring lamp
above his head. &#8220;There&#8217;s a hole with a stick in it just
at your elbow. I&#8217;ve been filling the holes as we made
them. In view of what I expect those folks in the city
are arranging, it seemed advisable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler was sensible of a certain uneasiness as he listened
to the crunch of the boring tool and the jarring
thud of the hammers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going so far down for?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;To get into sounder rock. It&#8217;s costing us considerable
time that we can badly spare, but once or twice I
fancied the whole river was coming in on us. Now
we&#8217;re getting almost through, I want to make quite sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler nodded. &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s wise. So far, we
have come out ahead of Hutton and the rest of them,&#8221;
he asserted. &#8220;Our people hold the timber rights, and we
have got the shingle-splitting plant in. You headed him
off in Waynefleet&#8217;s case, and there only remains the man
with the old Bush claim. There&#8217;s, unfortunately, no
doubt about his title to the ranch, and it&#8217;s a sure thing
the folks in the city will put him up again. Have you
heard from him lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; answered Nasmyth, with a smile. &#8220;As you
know, I made him half a dozen different offers to buy
him out. He naturally didn&#8217;t close with them, but he
wrote trying to raise me, and kept the thing up rather
well. Of course, it was evident that his friends were
quite willing to let me get most of the work done before
they showed their hand too visibly. I scarcely fancy
they know how near we are to getting through, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
that rancher man&#8217;s lawyer said something about taking
proceedings a little while ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose they went to court, and served you with a
notice to quit what you&#8217;re doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth, turning, pointed with a wet, scarred hand to
several holes in the side of the heading, from which a
wire projected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they&#8217;d have to serve it, and while
their man was trying to get down the gully I&#8217;d rip most
of the bottom out of this strip of ca&ntilde;on. I&#8217;m not sure
we haven&#8217;t gone far enough already to split up the whole
ridge that&#8217;s holding back the river. Still, I&#8217;m going on
a little. I mean to make sure.&#8221; He bent over the machine.
&#8220;You have brought up some letters? The man
has, perhaps, been trying to worry me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two or three,&#8221; replied Wheeler. &#8220;I called at the
settlement for them. One is evidently from a lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth swung round again and took the little dainty
envelope from him. He smeared it with his wet hands
as he opened it, and then his voice broke sharply through
the thud of the hammers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you move? I&#8217;m too far from that lamp,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>He scrambled by Wheeler and crouched close beneath
the smoky, flickering flame, dripping, spattered with mire,
and very grim in face. The note was from Violet Hamilton,
and it was brief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to see you as soon as you can get
away,&#8221; it read. &#8220;There is something I must say, and
since it might spare both of us pain, I feel almost tempted
to try to explain it now. That, however, would perhaps
be weak of me, and I think you will, after all, not
blame me very greatly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung the note down in the water, and straightened
himself wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am invited to go down to Bonavista, and it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
tolerably clear that I have another trouble to face,&#8221; he
announced in a dull tone. &#8220;In the meanwhile there&#8217;s this
heading to be pushed on, and it seems to me that the
thing that counts most is what I owe the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler, who had heard something from Gordon,
looked at him with grave sympathy, but Nasmyth made
an expressive gesture as he glanced down at his attire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I probably look very much
what I am&ndash;&ndash;a played-out borer of headings and builder
of dams, who has just now everything against him. Still,
I was fool enough to indulge in some very alluring fancies
a little while ago.&#8221; He turned to Wheeler with a
sudden flash in his eyes. &#8220;You can take those letters to
Gordon and tell him to open them. I&#8217;ve a little trouble
to grapple with, and I don&#8217;t feel inclined for conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler could take a hint, and he crawled away along
the heading, while Nasmyth toiled for the next half-hour
strenuously at the machine. The perspiration dripped
from him. He gasped as he ripped the handle around;
then he let it go suddenly, and his face became softer as
he picked up the letter again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can blame
her, after all, and with what she has to say it would hurt
if I kept her waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down again at the machine, and the boring tool
crunched on steadily into the rock until after some time,
a man took his place, and, crouching in the narrow heading,
swung the heavy hammer as they wedged the extra
timbers fast. A faint grey light was creeping into the
eastern sky when Nasmyth crawled out of the heading
and scrambled back to the shanty. Gordon, who was
getting up when he entered, looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going into Bonavista after breakfast,&#8221; Nasmyth
said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to leave the boys now, but I can&#8217;t
help it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>Gordon asked no injudicious questions, for Wheeler
had mentioned the letter, and his comrade&#8217;s voice had its
significance for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell Mattawa to have the horse
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth slept soundly until the meal was laid out.
He rode into the settlement a little before dark that
night. It was the next afternoon when he reached Bonavista,
and he found Violet Hamilton sitting upon the
veranda alone. She appeared embarrassed when she saw
him, and he leaned against one of the pillars, quietly
looking down on her. For a moment or two neither of
them said anything, and it was Nasmyth who broke the
awkward silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt very bitter when I got that note,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;When I grappled with the thing, however, I commenced
to realize that you might be right. Of course, I quite
realized all you wished to imply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; answered the girl softly, &#8220;then you are not
very angry with me.&#8221; She leaned forward and met his
gaze. &#8220;I think we were both very nearly making a terrible
mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely think that is a thing you could expect me
to admit&ndash;&ndash;that is, at least, as far as my part in it goes,&#8221;
said Nasmyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; replied Violet, &#8220;you admitted that you felt I
might be right.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked anxious, and Nasmyth realized that, since
she might have written what she had to say, it must have
cost her a good deal to break with him personally. The
courage which had prompted her to summon him appealed
to him, and, in place of anger, he was conscious of
a certain sympathy for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one sense you were certainly right,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We belong to different worlds, and I should never have
spoken to you as I did. That is a thing you must try to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
forgive me, and you have no reason to blame yourself.
As I told you at the time, you were free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried Violet, &#8220;you are very generous. After
all, I expected that from you, and I think it will not
hurt you very much to give me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why?&#8221; asked Nasmyth gravely.</p>
<p>Violet sat silent a moment or two, and then looked up
at him quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you owe so much to that girl in the
Bush! She would always have come between us. I
think you made me recognize it when you told me about
her, though it was only by degrees I came to understand
it clearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth&#8217;s face flushed. &#8220;That,&#8221; he queried, &#8220;is
your reason for wishing to get rid of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet looked away from him, and there was a telltale
self consciousness in her manner when she turned to him
again. Nasmyth, who noticed it, winced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he hazarded, &#8220;it was, perhaps, not the only
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; confessed Violet very softly, &#8220;there was another
thing which influenced me rather more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth, who understood her, stood silent a moment
or two, with one hand tightly closed. &#8220;In that case
there is nothing to be said, and I must try to face it gracefully,&#8221;
he told her. &#8220;Reproaches are not exactly becoming
in the case of a discarded man.&#8221; He took off his
wide hat as he held out his hand. &#8220;Miss Hamilton, the
thing naturally hurts me, but perhaps I cannot reasonably
blame you. I&#8217;m not sure you could expect me to go any
further now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Violet, &#8220;you have made it easy. I
would like to assure you of my good-will.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held her hand a moment and swung abruptly away.
He met Mrs. Acton as he went down a corridor. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
stopped in front of her, and she looked at him questioningly
when she saw his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not come up to expectations. It is, perhaps,
fortunate Miss Hamilton found it out when she did,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Mrs. Acton replied, &#8220;I told you it would not
be well to stay away very long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely think the result would have been different
in any case,&#8221; Nasmyth declared.</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton was silent for a moment. Then she looked
at him sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going now?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the world I belong to,&#8221; answered Nasmyth,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;to
the railroad, in the first case. I&#8217;m not sure that
Miss Hamilton would like to feel that I was in the
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton made no protest, and ten minutes later he
had crossed the clearing and plunged into the Bush.</p>
<p>Mrs. Acton, crossing the veranda, laid her hand on the
girl&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I naturally don&#8217;t know what he said to you, but I
can&#8217;t help believing that he acquitted himself rather well,&#8221;
she observed. &#8220;After all, it must have been a little painful
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was,&#8221; replied Violet. &#8220;Still, I don&#8217;t think
it hurt him dreadfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was more or less correct in this surmise, for, as
Nasmyth walked on through the Bush, he became conscious
of a faint relief.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE LAST SHOT</h3>
</div>
<p>Laura Waynefleet was preparing breakfast,
and the door of the ranch stood open, when she
heard the sharp clatter of the flung-down slip-rails in the
fence across the clearing jar upon the stillness of the surrounding
woods. It was early in the morning, and since it
was evident that, if the strangers who were approaching
came from the settlement, they must have set out as soon
as it was light, she decided that their business was probably
urgent. Laying down the frying-pan in which she was
making flapjacks, she moved toward the door, and stood
watching two men ride across the clearing in the direction
of the house. They did not belong to the settlement, for
she had never seen either of them before, a fact which
made it clear that they had not ridden in from the ca&ntilde;on.
She had quick eyes, and she noticed that, although they
could not have ridden very far that morning, their horses
appeared jaded, which suggested that they had made a
long journey the previous day. The men appeared weary,
too, and she imagined that they were not accustomed to
the Bush.</p>
<p>As she watched them she wondered with a trace of
uneasiness what their business could be, and decided that
it was, perhaps, as well that her father was busy in the
stable, where he could not hear them arrive. Since Gordon
usually called at the ranch when he went down to
the settlement, she was more or less acquainted with what
was being done at the ca&ntilde;on and with Nasmyth&#8217;s affairs,
and she was on her guard when one of the strangers
pulled his horse up close in front of her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Can we hire a couple of horses here?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Ours are played out.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was then a cayuse pony in Waynefleet&#8217;s stable,
but it belonged to a neighbouring rancher, and Laura had
no intention of handing it over to the strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;The only horse on
the ranch does not belong to us, and I wouldn&#8217;t care to
hire it out unless I had permission. Besides, I may want
it myself. You could have obtained horses at the settlement
hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t put up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must have come through the settlement.
You have evidently ridden in from the railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;we certainly
did, but we got off the trail last night, and they
took us in at Bullen&#8217;s ranch. Soon after we started out a
chopper told us we could save a league by riding up the
valley instead of by the settlement. Does the man
you said the horse belonged to live in the neighbourhood?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura did not answer immediately. She was quick-witted,
and she recognized that, while the man&#8217;s explanation
was plausible, there were weak points in it. For one
thing, the previous night had not been dark, and it was
difficult to understand how anyone could have wandered
off the wide trail to the settlement into the one which led
through thick undergrowth to Bullen&#8217;s ranch. She guessed
that the strangers must have had an object in not visiting
the settlement. Then there was, it seemed to her, something
suggestive in the fact that Bullen, who had a share
in Nasmyth&#8217;s project, and owned several horses, had not
seized upon the opportunity to aid the travellers, for, if
he had not been willing to lend his horses, it could only
have been because he was a little dubious about the
strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who owns the horse lives at least an hour&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
ride away,&#8221; she informed the stranger. &#8220;You are going
on into the Bush?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the man. &#8220;Can you tell us the easiest
way to reach the ca&ntilde;on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura was glad that he had asked for the easiest route,
for soon after the snow had gone, Nasmyth had broken
out a shorter and somewhat perilous trail over the steepest
part of the divide. Only the pack-horses now went round
by the longer way. She thought hard for a moment or
two, and then told the man how to find the old trail.</p>
<p>He rode away with his companion, and Laura&#8217;s face
was thoughtful when she sat down again. She made a
hasty breakfast, and went out to the stable. Waynefleet
was still busy when she reached it, and she took
down the side-saddle before she turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have left your breakfast ready, but you must excuse
me,&#8221; she announced; &#8220;I am going to the ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waynefleet raised his brows and looked at her with
his most precise air, but, seeing that had no effect, he
made a gesture of resignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I presume you do not, as
usual, think it worth while to acquaint me with your
object.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly sure of it myself.
I may tell you a little more when I come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the horse out, and, crossing the clearing, rode
hard for a league or so, and then made sure by the prints
of their horses&#8217; feet that the strangers had followed her
instructions before she struck into the shorter trail. It
was scarcely wide enough to ride along, and for a while
dense thickets of fern and undergrowth closed in on it.
Further on, it skirted a quaggy swamp, and led through
several rapid creeks, while here and there great fallen
trees compelled her to turn aside, and there were groves
of willows to be painfully struggled through. The cayuse
she rode was, however, more or less accustomed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
that kind of work, and she made tolerable progress until
she reached the foot of the big divide. There she dismounted,
and led the cayuse up a steep gully through
which a torrent poured. They stumbled amidst big
boulders and over slippery shingle until they reached the
head of the gully, and then there were almost precipitous
slopes of rock to be faced. They climbed for a couple
of hours, and Laura gasped with relief when at last she
stood upon the crest of the divide.</p>
<p>The descent was perilous, but already the sun hung
low above the western hills, and she went down in the
saddle with the cayuse slipping and stumbling horribly,
until the roar of the river came faintly up to her. Then
she drew bridle, and glanced ruefully at her attire. Her
skirt was rent in places, and one little shoe had burst. A
branch that had torn her hat off had loosened a coil of
gleaming hair, and, anxious as she was, she stopped for
several minutes to set these matters straight as far as it
was possible. There was, she felt, after all, no reason
why Nasmyth should see her in that state. Then she
rode on, and a little later a man appeared among the
pines at the head of the gully. She was very weary when
she got down beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have two strangers arrived here yet?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the man.</p>
<p>Laura was glad she had undertaken the journey when
she saw the sudden intentness of his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of them are on the trail?&#8221; he inquired sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;They have gone round by the
pack-horse trail. I rode in by the new one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was astonished that she had accomplished
the trip, and she saw that he was troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he advised, &#8220;you had better go right on and
tell Nasmyth as quick as you can. It&#8217;s my business to see
no strangers get in, or I&#8217;d go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura left the horse with him, and, descending the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
gully, found an unusual number of men busy beside the
river. In fact, she believed that all those who had been
at work in the valley must have crossed the range to the
ca&ntilde;on. It was also evident from their faces that most
of them were in a state of eager expectation. Something
out of the usual course was clearly going on. She asked
for Nasmyth, and a few moments later he came scrambling
towards her along the log staging. There was, she
was quick to notice, a strained look in his eyes, but he
shook hands with her, and then, remembering the state
of her attire, she coloured a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect two men from the city to-night?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>Nasmyth started. &#8220;I have, at least, been wondering
when they would turn up,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;There are
two men of that kind on the trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was sharp and insistent, and Laura told him
hastily about the men who had called at the ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what you say, they can&#8217;t well be here for
another hour or two,&#8221; he said, and there was a determined
glint in his eyes. &#8220;I fancy we&#8217;ll be through by
then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung around, and raised a hand to the men.
&#8220;Boys, you&#8217;ll get the last holes filled with giant-powder
as quick as you can, and couple up the firing battery.
We&#8217;ll lift that rock right out when you&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned again to Laura. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure you understand
all that you have done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For one thing,
I think, you have saved us from being beaten when what
we have fought for was almost in our hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, and then his voice became
hoarse as he indicated the clustering men with a little
forceful gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have come in to see the last shot fired. We
had arranged to put in a few more sticks of powder, and
then lower the river once for all in another hour or two.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
Some of the boys are now getting a big supper ready to
celebrate the occasion, but if you hadn&#8217;t brought us the
warning, it&#8217;s scarcely likely that any of us would have
felt much inclined for festivity. In all probability, those
strangers are bringing an order to restrain me from going
any further. Once it was in my hands, I could not have
fired the shot. All we have done would have been
thrown away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried Laura, &#8220;that would be intolerable!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth laughed significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any way,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;until the papers are served
on me, my charter stands. We&#8217;ll have scattered the last
strip of rock when those men ride in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made her a grave little bow. &#8220;You set us to
work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is only fitting that you should once
more hold the firing battery.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved away abruptly from her and crawled into
the heading. It was half an hour later when he came
back, and almost every man who had a share in the undertaking
gathered upon the strip of shingle. Nobody
spoke, however, and there was tense expectancy in the
bronzed faces. Nasmyth beckoned to Laura and moved
forward with Gordon, and Wheeler, who carried the
battery. Nasmyth swung his battered hat off as he held
out his hand, and Laura, clinging to him, climbed to a
shelf of rock where she stood still a moment or two, looking
about her.</p>
<p>In front the white spray of the fall whirled beneath
the tremendous wall of rock, and about her stood groups
of hard-handed men, who had driven the heading with
strenuous, insistent toil. She knew what the work had
cost them, and could understand the look in their steady
eyes. They had faced the river in the depths of the tremendous
rift, borne with the icy winter, and patiently
grappled with obstacle after obstacle. Their money had
not sufficed to purchase them costly machines. They had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
pitted steadfast courage and hardened muscle against the
vast primeval forces of untrammelled Nature. Laura
felt deeply stirred as she glanced at them. They were
simple men, but they had faced and beaten roaring flood
and stinging frost, caring little for the hazard to life
or limb as they played their part in that tremendous struggle
with axe and drill.</p>
<p>Suddenly Laura became conscious that Nasmyth, who
held up a little box from which trailed a couple of wires,
was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our last dollars bought that powder. Wish us good
luck,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Laura stretched out her hands for the box, and standing
upon the rock shelf, with one shoe burst and her
skirt badly rent, raised her voice as she had done in that
spot once before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have stood fast against very
heavy odds. May all that you can wish for&ndash;&ndash;orchards,
oat-fields, wheat, and cattle&ndash;&ndash;be yours. The prosperity of
this country is founded on such efforts as you have made.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a little smile in her eyes, she fitted in the firing-plug,
and in another moment a streak of flame that seemed
to expand into a bewildering brilliancy flashed through
the spray of the fall. The flash of light was lost in
rolling smoke and a tremendous eruption of flying rock
that rang with deafening detonations against the side of
the ca&ntilde;on. The smoke rolled higher, and still great
shattered fragments came whirling out of it, striking
boulder and shingle with a heavy crash, until the roar
of the liberated river rose in tumultuous clamour and
drowned all other sound.</p>
<p>A great foaming wave swept forward, washing high
along the bank, and poured seething down the rapid.
Shingle and boulder were lost in it. It drove on tumultuously,
and a mad turgid flood came on behind. Then
it slowly fell away again, and a man, clambering out, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
peril of being swept away, beneath the dripping rock,
flung up a hand. His voice rang harsh and exultant
through the sinking roar of the beaten river.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve cut the last ledge clean away,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A great shout went up, and Nasmyth held out his
hand to Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe it all to you,&#8221; he said with a curious gleam in
his eyes.</p>
<p>The men trooped about them both, and, though they
were not as a rule effusive, some of them thumped Nasmyth&#8217;s
shoulder and some wrung his hand. Half an hour
had slipped by before he was free of them.</p>
<p>He and Laura went slowly back up the climbing gully.
It was growing dark, but a light still streamed down between
the pines, and Nasmyth, who pointed to a tree that
had fallen, stood close by, looking down upon the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will ride back with you presently, but you must
rest first; and I have something to say, though if we had
not beaten the river I think I should never have had
courage enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you found me lying
in the snow, you took me in; you nursed me back to life,
gave me a purpose, and set me on my feet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment. A flush dyed his worn face,
and his voice was strained when he went on again.</p>
<p>&#8220;One result was that I went back to the world I once
belonged to&ndash;&ndash;it was really you who sent me&ndash;&ndash;and you
know what befell me there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I
quite forgot what I owed to you, but I was carried away.
Still, she recognized her folly and discarded me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped again, and Laura looked at him steadily
with a tinge of colour in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that was when I commenced
to understand exactly what you had been all along to me.
I don&#8217;t know what came upon me at Bonavista; but
though the thing must seem preposterous, I believe I was
in love with you then. Now I have nothing to bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
you. You know all my weak points, and I could not
complain if you would not listen to me. But I have come
back to you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; answered Laura very softly, &#8220;after all, it was
fortunate that you went away. I think it was a relief
to me when Wisbech took you to the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth looked at her in surprise, and she smiled at
him. &#8220;Derrick,&#8221; she said, &#8220;once or twice when you
were building the dam you fancied that you loved me. I,
however, didn&#8217;t want you to fancy. That was only going
far enough to hurt me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth stooped toward her. &#8220;In the height of my
folly I had an uneasy consciousness that I belonged to
you. Afterwards I was sure. It was a very real thing,
but I naturally shrank from coming to you. I don&#8217;t
quite know how I have gathered the courage now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura sat still, and he laid a hand on her shoulder.
Then she turned and looked up at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she confessed very simply, &#8220;I think I loved
you in the days when you were building the dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bent down and kissed her, and neither of them
ever remembered exactly what they said.</p>
<p>A few minutes later there was a clatter in the shadow
above them, and two men came scrambling down, each
leading a jaded horse. Nasmyth rose and turned toward
them when they stopped close in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have some business with me?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>One of them handed him a sealed paper, and he opened
it with deliberation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may as well tell you that I expected this,&#8221; he said.
He glanced at Laura. &#8220;I am summoned to attend in
Victoria and show cause why I should not be restrained
from injuring the holding of a rancher at the head of the
valley. In the meantime I am instructed to carry on the
operations in the ca&ntilde;on no further.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to the men. &#8220;You should have come along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
an hour or two ago. I don&#8217;t propose to do anything
further in the ca&ntilde;on; in fact, I have accomplished the
purpose I had in hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>As his meaning dawned on them, the men gazed at
each other in evident consternation, until one of them
turned to Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;in that case I guess it&#8217;s quite
a pity we didn&#8217;t, but I begin to understand the thing.
This is the young lady who told us the trail. She must
have taken a shorter way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura smiled at him. &#8220;You,&#8221; she reminded him,
&#8220;seemed anxious to go by the easiest one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man looked at Nasmyth. &#8220;I&#8217;m acting for
Hutton, and it seems you have got ahead of him,&#8221; he observed.
&#8220;Still, we&#8217;re both out on business, and I don&#8217;t
bear you any ill-will. In fact, if you&#8217;re open to make any
arrangement, I should be glad to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nasmyth smiled as he answered: &#8220;You can at least
come and get some supper. I expect the boys will fix you
and your horses for the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went down the gully together, and a few minutes
later walked into the flickering light of a great fire, near
which a rudely bountiful supper had been laid out. Nasmyth
pointed to the strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;these are the men we expected, but
I don&#8217;t think they mean to worry us now, and they&#8217;ve
had a long ride.&#8221; He turned to the strangers. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
you sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a great burst of laughter, and one of the
strangers smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in your hands, but I don&#8217;t know any reason
why you shouldn&#8217;t be generous, boys,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He sat down, but for a moment or two Nasmyth and
Laura stood still in the glare of the fire, and the eyes of
everyone were fixed upon them. Laura&#8217;s face was flushed,
but Nasmyth was calm with a new dignity.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We have a little more to do, boys, but we have left
the toughest of our troubles behind,&#8221; Nasmyth spoke in
confident tones. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have another supper when
we&#8217;re through with it, and I&#8217;ll expect every one of you
at the biggest event in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a great shout that rang through the roar of
the rapid and far across the climbing pines. Then the
men sat down, and it was a little while later when their
leader and the girl quietly slipped away from them.
Those who noticed this said nothing, and the men still
sat round the snapping fire when Nasmyth and Laura
crossed the ridge of the divide.</p>
<p>There was a moon above them, and the night was soft
and clear, while the Bush rolled away beneath, shadowy
and still. Only the turmoil of the river came faintly up
to them. The muffled sound sent a curious thrill through
both of them, but they were silent as they went down the
long slope among the climbing pines. Laura sat in the
saddle, looking out on the silent forest with eyes that
shone softly in the moonlight, and Nasmyth walked beside
her, with his hand on the pack-horse&#8217;s bridle. They
had both borne the stress and strain, but now as the pack-horse
plodded on they were conscious only of a deep contentment.</p>
